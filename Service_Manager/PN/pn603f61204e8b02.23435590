<html><p>With SM9.52 P7 Web Tier the parameter&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;querySecurity</p>

<p>in web.xml has been changed to default to "true".&nbsp;</p>

<p>With older SM9.52 P6 Web Tier the default for this parameter was "false".&nbsp;</p>

<p>This becomes&nbsp;important if you use links for interactions for example in emails. The links will not work if you do not use queryhashcode or set the querySecurity to "false".&nbsp;</p>

<p>We recommend to set "querySecurity" to true and use "queryhashcode" in sm.ini.&nbsp;</p>

<p>You need to consider how you want to set the parameters "querySecurity" (web.xml) and "queryhashcode" (sm.ini).</p>
