<html><p>The following document will assist with the deployment of Micro Focus Data Protector on Linux. While all of this information is available in the general documentation, it serves as a step-by-step guide to assist new users.</p>

<h2>General Preparation</h2>

<p>Check the <a href="/itom/Data_Protector:latest/SystemRequirements">Data Protector Platform and Integration Support Matrix</a> document to learn more about supported operating systems for the Linux Cell Manager and other components.</p>

<p>Refer to <a href="/itom/Data_Protector:latest/Scalability">this link</a> for information on scaleability of the Cell Manager</p>

<p>Revisit the <a href="/itom/Data_Protector:latest/PreInstallTasks">complete list of pre-requesites</a> for Cell Manager deployment in the official documentation</p>

<h2>Prepare Linux for the Cell Manager</h2>

<p>The following sections describe general assumptions for the Linux operating system platform and how it should be configured for an optimal Data Protector Cell Manager deployment. While most of the requirements are identical there are slight differences for RHEL-based distributions and SLES.</p>

<div class="Admonition_Note"><strong>Note: </strong>The information below are a general guidance. Using different installation options are fully supported, but addtional steps required will not be covered in this guide.</div>

<h3>Red Hat Linux Server, Oracle Enterprise Linux and CentOS 8.x</h3>

<p>RedHat 8.x with a Minimal Installation and the following additional software:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Standard</li>
	<li>Headless Management</li>
	<li>Guest Agents (if this is a Virtual Machine)</li>
</ul>

<p>Configure networking and NTP. Make sure that the system is configured with a FQDN. The FQDN must be resolved using /etc/hosts and/or DNS.</p>

<h3>SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 15.x</h3>
