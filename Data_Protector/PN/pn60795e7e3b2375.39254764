<html><p>The following document will assist with the deployment of Micro Focus Data Protector on Linux. While all of this information is available in the general documentation, it serves as a step-by-step guide to assist new users.</p>

<h2>General Preparation</h2>

<p>Check the <a href="/itom/Data_Protector:latest/SystemRequirements">Data Protector Platform and Integration Support Matrix</a> document to learn more about supported operating systems for the Linux Cell Manager and other components.</p>

<p>Refer to <a href="/itom/Data_Protector:latest/Scalability">this link</a> for information on scaleability of the Cell Manager</p>

<p>Revisit the <a href="/itom/Data_Protector:latest/PreInstallTasks">complete list of pre-requesites</a> for Cell Manager deployment in the official documentation</p>

<h2>Prepare Linux for the Cell Manager</h2>

<p>The following sections describe general assumptions for the Linux operating system platform. The goal is to prepare the Linux operating system&nbsp;properly for a successful Data Protector Cell Manager deployment. While most of the requirements are identical, there are slight differences for RHEL-based distributions and SLES. Please follow the steps in the apropriate section.</p>

<p>This guide was created with Micro Focus Data Protector A.10.91 on SLES15 SP2 and RHEL8 U1. It is expected that the steps shared will be also valid for more recent versions of Data Protector and the Linux operating system.</p>

<div class="Admonition_Note"><strong>Note: </strong>Using different installation options as described here is supported, but might result in addtional steps neccesary not covered by this guide.</div>

<h3>Red Hat Linux Server 8.x</h3>

<p>This assumes that a Minimal Installation&nbsp;of RHEL 8.x is performed.</p>

<div class="Admonition_Note"><strong>Note:</strong>&nbsp;You can also follow this section for Cell Manager deployments on Oracle Enterprise Linux and CentOS as they share the same requirements.</div>

<p>Make sure to include at least the following&nbsp;software components as part of the installation process:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Standard</li>
	<li>Headless Management</li>
	<li>Guest Agents (If the server is a Virtual Machine)</li>
</ul>

<p></p>

<p></p>

<ul>
</ul>

<p>Configure networking and NTP. Make sure that the system is configured with a FQDN. The FQDN must be resolved using /etc/hosts and/or DNS.</p>

<p>Disable the firewall (SLES part of setup, RHEL it is enabled by default and must be disabled/configured later)</p>

<p>enable SSH&nbsp;</p>

<p></p>

<h3>SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 15.x</h3>

<p>This assumes that a Minimal Installation&nbsp;of SLES 15.x is performed while the&nbsp;Basesystem Module and Server Applications Module&nbsp;have been selected.</p>

<p>Make sure to include at least the following&nbsp;software components as part of the installation process:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Minimal Base System</li>
	<li>Enhanced Base System</li>
	<li>32-Bit Runtime Environment</li>
	<li>YaST System Administraton</li>
	<li>Software Management</li>
</ul>

<h2>Deploy Cell Manager on Linux</h2>

<p></p>

<h3>Pre-flight checks</h3>

<p>Verify the result of the command <code>hostname</code> and&nbsp;<code>dnsdomainname</code>. Both should return valid results or modification to the network configuration (DNS or <code>/etc/hosts</code>) are required.</p>

<h3>Perform the Installation</h3>

<p>Copy the installation package&nbsp;Micro_Focus_DP_10.91_Linux_DP_A1091_GPLx86_64.tar.gz to the server system. You can use SCP or mount a network share from the Linux Server and copy it to a local file system.</p>

<p>TBD</p>

<h3>Post-Installation Steps</h3>

<p>Add to $PATH</p>
