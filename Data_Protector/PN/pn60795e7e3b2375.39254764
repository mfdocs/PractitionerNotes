<html><p>The following document will assist with the deployment of Micro Focus Data Protector on Linux. While all of this information is available in the general documentation, it serves as a step-by-step guide to assist new users.</p>

<h2>General Preparation</h2>

<p>Check the <a href="/itom/Data_Protector:latest/SystemRequirements">Data Protector Platform and Integration Support Matrix</a> document to learn more about supported operating systems for the Linux Cell Manager and other components.</p>

<p>Refer to <a href="/itom/Data_Protector:latest/Scalability">this link</a> for information on scaleability of the Cell Manager</p>

<p>Revisit the <a href="/itom/Data_Protector:latest/PreInstallTasks">complete list of pre-requesites</a> for Cell Manager deployment in the official documentation</p>

<h2>Prepare Linux for the Cell Manager</h2>

<p>The following sections describe general assumptions for the Linux operating system platform. The goal is to prepare the Linux operating system&nbsp;properly for a successful Data Protector Cell Manager deployment. While most of the requirements are identical, there are slight differences for RHEL-based distributions and SLES. Please follow the steps in the apropriate section.</p>

<p>This guide was created with Micro Focus Data Protector A.10.91 on SLES15 SP2 and RHEL8 U1. It is expected that the steps shared will be also valid for more recent versions of Data Protector and the Linux operating system.</p>

<div class="Admonition_Note"><strong>Note: </strong>Using different installation options as described here is supported, but might result in addtional steps neccesary not covered by this guide.</div>

<h3>Red Hat Linux Server 8.x</h3>

<p>This assumes that a Minimal Installation&nbsp;of RHEL 8.x is performed.</p>

<div class="Admonition_Note"><strong>Note:</strong>&nbsp;You can also follow this section for Cell Manager deployments on Oracle Enterprise Linux and CentOS as they share the same requirements.</div>

<p>Make sure to include at least the following&nbsp;software components as part of the installation process:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Standard</li>
	<li>Headless Management</li>
	<li>Guest Agents (If the server is a Virtual Machine)</li>
</ul>

<p>Missing packages that should be installed using yum after the installation has been completed:</p>

<ul>
	<li>nscd</li>
</ul>

<p></p>

<p></p>

<ul>
</ul>

<p>Configure networking and NTP. Make sure that the system is configured with a FQDN. The FQDN must be resolved using /etc/hosts and/or DNS.</p>

<p>Disable the firewall (SLES part of setup, RHEL it is enabled by default and must be disabled/configured later)</p>

<p>enable SSH&nbsp;</p>

<p></p>

<h3>SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 15.x</h3>

<p>This assumes that a Minimal Installation&nbsp;of SLES 15.x is performed while the&nbsp;Basesystem Module and Server Applications Module&nbsp;have been selected.</p>

<p>Make sure to include at least the following&nbsp;software components as part of the installation process:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Minimal Base System</li>
	<li>Enhanced Base System</li>
	<li>32-Bit Runtime Environment</li>
	<li>YaST System Administraton</li>
	<li>Software Management</li>
</ul>

<p>Missing packages that should be installed using yum after the installation has been completed:</p>

<ul>
	<li></li>
</ul>

<h2>Deploy Cell Manager on Linux</h2>

<p></p>

<h3>Fullfill the Installation Requirements</h3>

<p><strong>Name Resolution on the Cell Manager</strong></p>

<p>Data Protector requires a properly configured name resolution. The preferred choice for name resolution is DNS with <code>nameserver</code>, <code>domain</code> and <code>search</code>&nbsp;options configured in <code>/etc/resolv.conf</code>. To ensure the Cell Manager is also fully operational in case DNS becomes unavailable, there should be also an apropriate entry in <code>/etc/hosts</code> for the Cell Manager system.</p>

<p>Let's assume the the primary IP of the Cell Manager lejcm08.mfdemo.local is 172.25.1.42&nbsp;then the&nbsp;<code>/etc/hosts</code> should contain the following entry.</p>

<pre style="background: rgb(238, 238, 238); border: 1px solid rgb(204, 204, 204); padding: 5px 10px;">172.25.1.42 &nbsp;lejcm08.mfdemo.local lejcm08
</pre>

<p>Verify the result using the&nbsp;<code>hostname</code> and&nbsp;<code>dnsdomainname</code> c<code>ommands</code>. Both should return expected results even if DNS is not responding. Please verify if forward and reverse DNS is properly configured for the Cell Manager.</p>

<pre style="background: rgb(238, 238, 238); border: 1px solid rgb(204, 204, 204); padding: 5px 10px;">[root@linux ~]# hostname
lejcm08
[root@linux ~]# dnsdomainname
mfdemo.local
[root@linux ~]# host lejcm08.mfdemo.local
lejcm08.mfdemo.local has address 172.25.1.42
[root@linux ~]# host 172.25.1.42
42.1.25.172.in-addr.arpa domain name pointer lejcm08.mfdemo.local.</pre>

<p>Enable <code>nscd</code> to cache DNS requests on the Cell Manager.</p>

<pre style="background: rgb(238, 238, 238); border: 1px solid rgb(204, 204, 204); padding: 5px 10px;">[root@linux ~]# systemctl enable nscd
[root@linux ~]# systemctl start nscd
</pre>

<p><strong>Create the User Running Data Protector Services</strong></p>

<p>The <code>AppServer</code> is executed as an unpriviledged user <code>hpdp</code>&nbsp;on the Cell Manager. This user must be created and have a existing home directory. It does not need to have a password.</p>

<pre style="background: rgb(238, 238, 238); border: 1px solid rgb(204, 204, 204); padding: 5px 10px;">[root@linux ~]# useradd -m hpdp
</pre>

<p><strong>Adjust the Open File Limit</strong></p>

<p>Edit the&nbsp;<code>/etc/security/limits.conf</code> and add the following lines to the end of the file. There are two entries for&nbsp;<code>root</code> and the&nbsp;<code>hpdp</code> user each.</p>

<pre style="background: rgb(238, 238, 238); border: 1px solid rgb(204, 204, 204); padding: 5px 10px;"># Open file limit for Data Protector Cell Manager
root            soft    nofile          8192
root            hard    nofile          16384
hpdp            soft    nofile          8192
hpdp            hard    nofile          16384</pre>

<div class="Admonition_Note"><strong>Note:</strong> After adding this you need to logout and login to make the changes active for root.</div>

<h3>Pre-flight Checks</h3>

<p>Perform as root</p>

<p>The <code>omnisetup.sh</code> script used for the installation and upgrade of Data Protector comes with a wide range of built-in pre-flight checks. So running the script will inform the user about missing dependencies and possible configuration issues. If a problem is found the installation is aborted and the user can fix the issues and retry.</p>

<p></p>

<p></p>

<h3>Perform the Installation</h3>

<p>Perform as root</p>

<p>unset LANG</p>

<p>Copy the installation package&nbsp;Micro_Focus_DP_10.91_Linux_DP_A1091_GPLx86_64.tar.gz to the server system. You can use SCP or mount a network share from the Linux Server and copy it to a local file system.</p>

<p>TBD</p>

<h3>Post-Installation Steps</h3>

<p>Add to $PATH</p>
