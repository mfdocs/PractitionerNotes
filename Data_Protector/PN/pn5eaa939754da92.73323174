<html><p>To allow system patching and other routine maintenance acitivies on the Cell Manager or a central Media Agent&nbsp;it may be required to stop and prevent new sessions from being started.</p>

<p>There are several options for this. You may stop the trigger on the Cell Manager using <code><tt>omnitrig -stop</tt></code>&nbsp;or change schedules of backups to prevent scheduled sessions from being executed. This will work in most of the cases, but does not prevent sessions from being executed started on client systems. This is quite often seen in environments with SAP HANA, where backups are triggered by the database itself or the SAP HANA Cockpit, or Oracle where RMAN is used to perform backups, restores or verifications.</p>

<h2>Enter the Maintenance Mode</h2>

<p>Use the command&nbsp;<code><tt>omnisv -maintenance</tt></code> to transition from Produtction to Maintenance Mode on the Cell Manager.</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Production to Phase 1: </strong>Sessions in progress will continue to run and new sessions are&nbsp;rejected by the Cell Manager. The trigger will be stopped.</li>
	<li><strong>Phase 1 to Phase 2: </strong>All sessions still in progress will be actively terminated including GUI connections</li>
	<li><strong>Phase 2 to Mainteance Mode:&nbsp;</strong>No sessions are running and&nbsp;new sessions are&nbsp;rejected by the Cell Manager. The trigger remains stopped.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Leave the Maintenance Mode</h2>

<p>Once the Cell Manager is in Maintenance Mode you can stop the services using <code><tt>omnisv -stop</tt></code> if needed or reboot the system.&nbsp;Maintenance Mode is persistent until you leave it using <code><tt>omnisv -maintenance -stop</tt></code>.</p>

<div class="Admonition_Note">Upgrading the Cell Manager system to a more recent version of Data Protector will also use the Maintenance Mode as part of the process. Once the upgrade is complete the system will leave the Maintenance Mode automatically.</div>

<h2>Related global Configuration Options</h2>

<p>There are two global options related to Maintenance Mode.&nbsp;<code><tt>MaintenanceModeGracefulTime</tt></code> (time to wait from entering <code><tt>omnisv -maintenance</tt></code> to Phase 1)&nbsp;and <code><tt>MaintenanceModeShutdownTime</tt></code> (time to wait from Phase 1 to Phase 2) can be used to adjust the wait times to match your environment.</p>

<h2>Abort Entering Maintenance Mode</h2>

<p>If you notice that important sessions will not complete in time, you can abort entering the Maintenance Mode by using <code>STRG+C</code> combination on your keyboard. Sessions will not abort, the Cell Manager will accept new backups and the trigger will be re-enabled.</p>

<pre>C:\&gt;omnisv -maintenance
Cell Server is entering maintenance mode
295 &nbsp;seconds left to abortion of all running sessions ...</pre>

<h2>Force Maintenance Mode</h2>

<p>If you need for quickly enter Maintenance Mode you can use the command&nbsp;<code><tt>omnisv -maintenance 1</tt></code>. It will not wait for the session to complete and immeadiately try to abort them.</p>
