The Legacy Scheduler was so popular that it was made available (again) in Data Protector A.10.20. With all its benefits there are some limitations such as scheduling beginning- and end of month backups, copies and reports is not directly possible. But it can be done if you know how to modify the schedule file for the corresponding specification.<div><br></div><div>If you're new to this, we need to start with some basics. If the Legacy Scheduler is available in your Data Protector (not the case for releases A.10.00 up to A.10.10), a schedule for a specification (backup, copy, replication, consolidation, report groups) is stored in an ASCII file on the Cell Manager. If there is no schedule defined, the file will be empty. You can find the files in the corresponding folders on the Cell Manager. The files are read by a process called omnitrig every 1 or every 15 minutes depending on your configuration.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>%DP_DATA_DIR%\Config\Server\Schedules or&nbsp;/etc/opt/omni/server/schedules for <b>file system backup specs</b><br></div><div><span style="background-color: transparent;">%DP_DATA_DIR%\Config\Server</span>\Barschedules or&nbsp;/etc/opt/omni/server/barschedules for <b>integration backup specs</b>,<b>&nbsp;</b>such as MSSQL, Exchange, VEAgent (VMware) and others<br></div><div>%DP_DATA_DIR%\Config\Server\rptschedules or&nbsp;/etc/opt/omni/server/rptschedules for <b>report groups</b><br></div><div>%DP_DATA_DIR%\Config\Server\copylists\scheduled\schedules or&nbsp;/etc/opt/omni/server/copylists/scheduled/schedules for <b>scheduled copy or replication specs</b><br></div><div>%DP_DATA_DIR%\Config\Server\consolidationlists\scheduled\schedules or&nbsp;/etc/opt/omni/server/consolidationlists/scheduled/schedules for <b>schedules consolidation specs</b></div><div><br></div>
