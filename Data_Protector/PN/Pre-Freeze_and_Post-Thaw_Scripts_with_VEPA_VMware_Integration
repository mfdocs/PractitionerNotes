</pre><h1>Manually Testing the
Scripts</h1><div>

<p class="MsoNormal">While developing your pre-freeze/post-thaw script solution
it might be handy to have a quick solution to test it without running a backup.
In that case use the VMware vCenter client to create a VM snapshot with the <i>Quiesce guest file system</i> option
defined.<o:p></o:p></p>

<h1><b>Using the Scripts in
a Data Protector VMware backup</b></h1>

<p class="MsoNormal">To allow the VMware Tools to execute the scripts during the VMware
Snapshot backup the option <i>Use quiescence
snapshots</i> must be used. This can be enabled on the top of the VMware Datacenter,
a folder or on an individual VM. To configure it use Configure Virtual Machine
from the context menu on the VM, folder or Datacenter in the Source tree. You
may need to un-tick the <i>Use common
settings for selected VM</i> are selected. Adjust the <i>Level of Error</i> to your needs. If the backup of the VM should be
performed even if the quiescence operation failed select <i>Warning</i>. Select <i>Fatal</i> only
if the backup of the VM should not be performed unless prepared by VSS and the
scripts.<o:p></o:p></p><p class="MsoNormal"><img src="./mediawiki/images/PN/2019-11-24_21h48_48b.png"><br></p></div></div>
