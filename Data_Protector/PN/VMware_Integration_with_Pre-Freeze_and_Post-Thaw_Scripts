<html><h2>Prerequisites</h2>

<div>
<p class="MsoNormal">The VMware Tools (or open-vm-tools) must be installed and running on the Virtual Machine. You must c<span style="font-size: inherit; letter-spacing: 0.2px; background-color: transparent;">reate the <i>backupScripts.d </i>directory where the scripts need to be executed.</span></p>

<ul>
	<li><i>/etc/vmware-tools/backupScripts.d</i> on Linux VMs</li>
	<li><i>C:\Program Files\VMware\VMware Tools\backupScripts.d</i> on Windows VMs</li>
</ul>

<p>The&nbsp;<i>backupScripts.d</i>&nbsp;directory may contain one or multiple scripts that will be executed in sequence. The file names of the scripts affect the execution order (e.g.&nbsp;<i>10-application.sh</i>, then&nbsp;<i>20-database.sh</i>). Each script must be able to handle&nbsp;<i>freeze, freezeFail&nbsp;</i>and<i>&nbsp;thaw</i>&nbsp;arguments passed by the VMware Tools during the different phases. Make sure the scripts are executable (permissions, correct type for the VM operating system).</p>

<h2><o:p>Sample Scripts</o:p></h2>

<p>The following sample scripts may be used to start custom integrations with VMware Tools and the application running on the VM.</p>

<h3>Sample Script for Linux</h3>

<pre>#!/bin/bash

if [[ $1 == "freeze" ]]
then

    # This section is executed before the Snapshot is created

elif [[ $1 == "freezeFail" ]]
then

    # This section is executed when a problem occurs during snapshot creation and we need to cleanup because thaw will not be executed

elif [[ $1 == "thaw" ]]
then

    # This section is executed when the Snapshot is removed

else

    echo "Usage: `/bin/basename $0` [ freeze | freezeFail | thaw ]"
    exit 1

fi
</pre>

<h3>Sample Script for Windows</h3>

<pre>@echo off

if "%~1" == ""         goto USAGE
if %1    == freeze     goto FREEZE
if %1    == freezeFail goto FREEZEFAIL
if %1    == thaw       goto THAW

:USAGE

echo Usage: %~nx0 [ freeze | freezeFail | thaw ]

goto END

:FREEZE

:: This section is executed before the Snapshot is created

goto END

:FREEZEFAIL

:: This section is executed when a problem occurs during snapshot creation and we need to cleanup because thaw will not be executed

goto END

:THAW

:: This section is executed when the Snapshot is removed

goto END

:END
</pre>

<h2>Manually Testing the Scripts</h2>

<div>
<p class="MsoNormal">While developing your pre-freeze/post-thaw script solution it might be handy to have a quick solution to test it without running a backup. In that case use the VMware vCenter client to create a VM snapshot with the&nbsp;<i>Quiesce guest file system</i>&nbsp;option defined.<o:p></o:p></p>

<h2>Using the Scripts in a Data Protector VMware backup</h2>

<p class="MsoNormal">To allow the VMware Tools to execute the scripts during the VMware Snapshot backup the option&nbsp;<i>Use quiescence snapshots</i>&nbsp;must be used. This can be enabled on the top of the VMware Datacenter, a folder or on an individual VM. To configure it use Configure Virtual Machine from the context menu on the VM, folder or Datacenter in the Source tree. You may need to un-tick the&nbsp;<i>Use common settings for selected VM</i>&nbsp;are selected. Adjust the&nbsp;<i>Level of Error</i>&nbsp;to your needs. If the backup of the VM should be performed even if the quiescence operation failed select&nbsp;<i>Warning</i>. Select&nbsp;<i>Fatal</i>&nbsp;only if the backup of the VM should not be performed unless prepared by VSS and the scripts.<o:p></o:p></p>
