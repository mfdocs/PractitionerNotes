<html><h2>Premise</h2>

<p>Due to the large amount of data associated with Showback cost reporting collections and the time it takes to retrieve the data from various providers, it often proves difficult to test and demo Showback and related service’s features. As such, it became abundantly apparent that some way of generating Showback collections to match a test or demo scenario in a shorter period of time and with less data was sorely needed. Enter Demo Data: the feature that leverages multitenancy within CGRO to allow demo tenant integrations to be created and collection results to be customized and run in a fraction of the time of a production collection.</p>

<h2>How it works</h2>

<p>Any collection run by a tenant designated as being in demo mode will automatically be seeded from Demo Data. Tenants in demo mode are designated by the IDM metadata key/value pair of <code>CGRO-TENANT-TIER/demo</code>.</p>

<p>Once a tenant in demo mode has been created, integrations can be configured. Upon creation of the first integration for the demo tenant, a folder is generated on the system. The default path for this folder on an NFS mount is <code>&lt;mount-path&gt;/demo-collection/&lt;tenant&gt;</code> where <code>&lt;tenant&gt;</code> is the name of the tenant in demo mode (this path can be changed by modifying the <code>DEFAULT_DEMO_TENANT_DROP_PATH</code> in the deployment yaml file). Within this folder, 6 files (explained in the next section) will be automatically generated with default Demo Data.</p>

<p>Upon first creation of an integration, the default Demo Data will be loaded and a collection will be run using this data. (Note: any credentials entered will be accepted, then ignored; collections and reports will run and be displayed without using valid credentials.) At the completion of the collection, reports for the created integration will be viewable and populated with default Demo Data that provides examples of general use cases of the reports, including years of data with usage trends, cloud tags and expressions.</p>

<h2>Files Created</h2>

<p>As mentioned in the previous section, 6 required files are created for Demo Data. This section overviews the purpose of each file and following sections cover the contents and how to customize them.</p>

<ul>
	<li><code>AwsDemoSeeds.json</code> and <code>AzureDemoSeeds.json</code> are used to specify the instances to create during collection (for AWS these instances are EC2, RDS and S3). Each of these seeds also allow for the specification of tags for each of the created instances. These seeds will produce and populate the line items in the db at collection time (including tags for both AWS and Azure).</li>
	<li><code>AwsDemoColumns.json</code> and <code>AzureDemoColumns.json</code> create custom columns for the seeds. These files behave essentially the same as POSTing bulk custom columns via the custom column api.</li>
	<li><code>AwsDemoExpressions.json</code> and <code>AzureDemoExpressions.json</code> create expressions that will populate the custom columns. These files behave essentially the same as a bulk POST via the expressions API.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Notes</h2>

<p>•&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Demo Data is retrieved from the file system every time a collection is created (not at the start of every collection). However, any Demo Data added through APIs will be added at the next collection (but be aware that it will only populate since the last collection, i.e. data will not be populated into the past).<br>
•&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;When an integration is deleted all seeds related to that tenant and provider are deleted as well. Currently created custom columns and expressions are not deleted (please see these the documentation for these features for deletion instructions).&nbsp;<br>
•&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;To customize the Demo Data, an integration must already have been created for the tenant. Once it is created, go into the associated tenant’s folder under the demo-collection folder and edit the file there to reflect the desired changes. Once the desired changes have been made, go back to the integration UI and delete the corresponding integration and recreate it. At this point a new collection will occur for the new seed values.<br>
•&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;* In order for AWS EC2 Demo Data to work correctly with Insights, the seeds created must include the following values:<br>
o&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;"region"<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Must have a value of either "GENERATE" or be set to one of the following: "eu-west-1", "us-west-2", "us-west-1", "ap-northeast-1", "us-east-1", "eu-central-1", "ap-southeast-1", "ap-south-1", "ca-central-1"<br>
