Micro Focus Hybrid Cloud Management (HCM) allows end users to deploy service instances such as virtual machines, applications, etc. After a service instance has been deployed, HCM displays all defined user actions to end users. Certain enterprises would like to display a subset of user actions to end users depending on state of service instance. Some of the example use cases that enterprises achieve are:<div><br><div><ul><li>When a virtual machine is in powered on status, “Start Server” user action is hidden from end users.</li><li>When a virtual machine is in powered off status, “Stop Server” user action is hidden from end users.<br></li><li>When a web site is up and running, “Start Web Service” user action is hidden from end users.<br></li></ul><div><br></div><div>Follow the steps below to change visibility of certain user actions for a deployed service from end users. In the steps discussed below, when a server is provisioned and powered on during the deployment, the “Start Server” action is hidden from end users.&nbsp; Similar steps can be used to either hide or expose user actions of your choice depending on service instance state.<br></div></div><div><ol><li>Get a list of&nbsp;Operations Orchestration (OO) flows that needs to be modified to change visibility of user actions<ul><li>Login to the HCM Service Management Console.</li><li>In HCM, user actions are configured on resource offerings or service components. User actions can be invoked by subscribers in the HCM Marketplace Portal (MPP) after a subscription has been provisioned. For example, a “Restart Server” user action can be configured on a server service component or on an associated resource offering.<br></li><li>The following are the two categories of OO flows that may need to be modified to change visibility of user actions:&nbsp;<br><ol><li><b>Service lifecycle OO flows</b>: The service lifecycle OO flows are defined in the “LIFECYCLE” tab of the service component and its associated resource offering’s “LIFECYCLE” tab.</li><li><b>User action OO flows</b>: The user action OO flows are defined in the “USER OPERATIONS” tab of the service component and its associated resource offering’s “USER OPERATIONS” tab. These are the user operations (actions) that an end user sees in HCM Marketplace Portal.</li></ol></li><li>Open the service design for the service that requires change in visibility of certain user actions.<br></li><li>Select and view the component that corresponds to service for which visibility of certain user actions have to be changed.<br></li><li>Click “LIFECYCLE” tab. Note down a list of OO flows that needs to be modified. In the sample screenshot below, there are no service lifecycle OO flows that are defined in the service component object.<br><img src="./mediawiki/images/PN/HCM-Visibility-CompLifecycle.png"><br></li><li>Click “USER OPERATIONS” tab. Note down a list of OO flows that needs to be modified. In the sample screenshot below, there are no OO flows that are defined as user operations in the service component object.<br><img src="./mediawiki/images/PN/HCM-Visibility-CompUserOperations.png"><br></li><li>Click “RESOURCE OFFERINGS” tab. Select the “SUN” icon and click “Navigate to Resource Offering”.<br></li><li>Click “LIFECYCLE” tab. In the sample screenshot below, “vCenter Deploy VM” OO flow is defined as a service lifecycle OO flow that provisions a VM. Note down a list of OO flows that needs to be modified. The “vCenter Deploy VM” OO flow may need to be modified so that “Start Server” user operation is hidden from end users after deployment of VM.<br></li><li>Click “USER OPERATIONS” tab. In the sample screenshot below, a list of user operation OO flows that are defined in “Resource Offering” object. These user operation OO flows appear as actions in end user marketplace portal. Note down a list of OO flows that needs to be modified. An example use case may be that after a “Start Server” user operation has been run successfully, “Start Server” user operation should be hidden from end users.<br></li></ul></li><li>Modify OO flows to change visibility of user actions depending on service instance state.</li></ol></div></div>
