<html><h2>HCMX Migration CLI</h2>

<p>The HCMX Migration tool provides all the required APIs to migrate CSA/HCM to HCMX. The HCMX Migration CLI script allows you to interact with the Migration Tool APIs providing the CLI experience.<br>
<br>
The HCMX Migration tool needs to be downloaded from the &lt;LINK&gt; Marketplace Portal. Detailed documentation of the migration process can be found &lt;LINK&gt; here. This document describes the CLI tool commands and it's usage.</p>

<h2>Prerequisite</h2>

<p>This document assumes that you have installed a working HCMX and its supporting components (RAS, UCMDB). Read the migration document to create all the prerequisite configurations (like tenant, LDAP, users, roles) in HCMX, and you have validated the basic set of designs on HCMX from the CSA/HCM instance to ensure they are working without any issues. Once you have completed these, then you are ready to perform the migration.<br>
<br>
The CLI script needs the following Linux library tools on the system, ensure they are installed;<br>
jq, awk, grep, sed, column</p>

<h2>Installation steps</h2>

<p>The CLI script (hcmxmig) needs to be copied to the 'script' folder in the migration directory, it will run on the same instance where the migration tool is executed. The CLI script needs any Linux environment for it to be installed, so you can either use the CSA/HCM nodes or HCMX nodes or a separate Linux system to deploy the migration tool and CLI script. You would also need a PostgreSQL database for the HCMX Migration tool to run, please check the Tool documentation for the details.<br>
<br>
Extract the migration tool archive to the directory (like hcmxmig) and create a script sub-directory. It should have the following structure;<br>
<br>
|- hcmxmig<br>
|- hcmxmig/hcmx-migration.jar<br>
|- hcmxmig/config/application.properties<br>
|- hcmxmig/script/hcmxmig<br>
<br>
Optionally you can add the hcmxmig CLI into the PATH variable, to do this add the following in the ~/.bash_profile<br>
PATH=$PATH:$HOME/bin:&lt;path&gt;/hcmxmig/script</p>

<h2>HCMX Migration Tool Configuration</h2>

<p>Once the migration tool is extracted, you can use the CLI script to install and configure the migration tool. Refer to the tool configuration section to configure. Follow the steps to configure and start the migration tool;</p>

<ol>
	<li>Configure the source, target URL, and its credentials. This will also add the URL certificates into the java trust store automatically, you might be prompted for the truststore password (default is “changeit”). Example:
	<p>hcmxmig tool configure --sourceUrl https://hostname:port/csa --sourceUser admin --sourcePwd password --targetUrl https://hostname/&lt;tenantid&gt;/dnd --targetUser dndadmin --targetPwd password</p>
	</li>
	<li>Configure the Postgresql database for the migration tool, only PostgreSQL is supported. The --certpath is optional and can be used to configure the SSL connection to Postgres.
	<ul>
		<li>To create the database in the PostgreSQL, execute the following SQL statements after connecting to the database server
		<p>create user hcmxmig login password '2the#moon' inherit;<br>
		create database hcmxmig with owner=hcmxmig;</p>
		</li>
		<li>Configure the migration tool with the database.
		<p>hcmxmig tool configuredb --dbhost hostname --dbport 5432 --dbname hcmx-migration --dbuser postgres --dbpass password --certpath /home/hcmxpgdb.crt</p>
		</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Install the HCMX Migration service. It will prompt you for a keystore generation (if not already done) for the hcmx-migration tool and creates a keystore, installs the 'hcmx-migration' service, and starts it. Example
	<p>hcmxmig tool install</p>
	</li>
	<li>Watch the HCMX Migration service status to ensure it's running and there no errors, you should see the swagger URL link which would mean the tool has started. Example
	<p>hcmxmig tool status</p>
	</li>
	<li>Login to the HCMX Migration tool, the default password is 'password'. This will be saved into the user profile for future use, a token is automatically generated and used for all further API calls. Example
	<p>hcmxmig tool login admin password</p>
	</li>
</ol>

<h2>High level migration steps</h2>

<p>Typically the HCMX migration contains the following sequence</p>

<h3>Migrating Design and OO Content</h3>

<ol>
	<li>Import all the OO content packs into HCMX</li>
	<li>Export/Import the designs and create offerings from CSA/HCM to the HCMX. hcmxmig CLI script provides option to transfer the design and offerings to HCMX. Please check the export/import section for more information.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Migrating Resource Providers</h3>

<ol>
	<li>Get the list of resource providers from CSA/HCM
	<p>hcmxmig get provider</p>
	</li>
	<li>Run precheck for the resource providers. Ensure there are no errors in the precheck and fix them if any
	<p>hcmxmig precheck provider &lt;comma-separated-provider-ids&gt;</p>
	</li>
	<li>Run migration for the resource providers which pass the precheck
	<p>hcmxmig migrate provider &lt;comma-separated-provider-ids&gt;</p>
	</li>
</ol>

<h3>Migrating Subscriptions</h3>

<p>The best way to migrate the subscriptions is to go by each offering. Migrate all the subscriptions of a given offering, then move on to the next offering in that design. Then move on to the next design.</p>

<ol>
	<li>Get the list of offerings from CSA/HCM - filter them as needed based on organization and offering name.
	<p>hcmxmig get offering --output offering.csv</p>
	</li>
	<li>Get the mapping for the designs based on the list of offerings in the CSV. Check and fix the mapping information in the CSV by checking the probable target offerings and set them in the TargetOfferingId.
	<p>hcmxmig get mapping &lt;design ids&gt;</p>
	</li>
	<li>Get the subscriptions for an offering and use the mapping information. Check and Fix the subscription list in the CSV, and set the PerformMigration field to 'Y' when you have a valid TargetOfferingId.
	<p>hcmxmig get subscription --output subscriptions.csv --use-mapping mapping.csv</p>
	</li>
	<li>Run precheck for the subscription using the subscription CSV. Ensure there are no errors in the precheck and fix them on HCMX if any
	<p>hcmxmig precheck subscription --input subscriptions.csv</p>
	</li>
	<li>Run migration for the subscription which passes the precheck
	<p>hcmxmig migrate subscription --input subscriptions.csv</p>
	</li>
</ol>

<p>Repeat the step 3-5 for all the offerings in that design, repeat the steps for a new design.</p>

<p>Check the CLI usage section for more details on each of these commands and their options.</p>

<p>After the migration, you need to perform the post-migration tasks which are documented in the migration guide &lt;LINK&gt;</p>

<h3>Export/Import Designs and Offerings</h3>

<p>The HCMX Migration CLI provides options to export the designs from CSA/HCM and import them to HCMX. For the migration to work, the offerings in HCMX have to be created using a naming convention that includes the offering version, using CLI you can create the offerings in HCMX with the correct naming convention. The offering created in HCMX is only the skeleton required for migration and the rest of the properties like pricing, option set, etc., need to manually configure in the HCMX offering based on the CSA/HCM offering.<br>
Use the design export command to export the design from CSA/HCMX, the design-id to export is passed in with --design parameter in the command. The exported design will be saved as the &lt;design-id&gt;.zip file. Example:</p>

<p>hcmxmig design export --design 2c90cf9370f7b9b10170f898bbd0187b<br>
<br>
Use the design import command to import the design into HCMX, the design archive file has to pass in with --input parameter in the command. You can only preview instead of importing using the --preview option, you can use --import along with the preview option to import the design if the preview is successful. Use the --designfailure option to control the Failure Handling on the design, set "true" for Pause on Errors or "false" for Fail on Errors on the design. Examples:</p>

<p>hcmxmig design import --input 2c90cf9370f7b9b10170f898bbd0187b.zip<br>
hcmxmig design import --input 2c90cf9370f7b9b10170f898bbd0187b.zip --preview --import --designfailure true<br>
<br>
Use the design transfer command to directly transfer the design from CSA/HCM to HCMX, instead of running two separate commands. With transfer command, you can pass in multiple design-ids at once to transfer the multiple designs in a single command. You can use the --preview, --import, and --designfailure options the same way as in design import. Example</p>

<p>hcmxmig design transfer --design 2c90cf9370f7b9b10170f898bbd0187b,2c90cf9370f7b9b10170f898bbd0187c --preview --import<br>
While transferring the design, you can optionally create the offering in the same command by passing --createoffering parameter. CLI will create the offering if the import/export is successful. You need to provide the service definition id with parameter --target-service-definition, the service definition id is in the HCMX under which the offering has to be created. Example:</p>

<p>hcmxmig design transfer --design 2c90cf9370f7b9b10170f898bbd0187b,2c90cf9370f7b9b10170f898bbd0187c --preview --import --createoffering --target-service-definition 10081 --designfailure true<br>
Use the offering transfer command to create the offerings in HCMX, use this if you have already imported design into HCMX. You can pass the specific offering-ids in CSA/HCM to be transfer or all the offerings of the design will be transferred when a design-id is passed. Example:<br>
hcmxmig offering transfer --design 2c90c4a577a555dd0177aa612c532d0e --target-service-definition 10202<br>
hcmxmig offering transfer --offering 2c90cf9370f7b9b10170f898bbd0187b,2c90cf9370f7b9b10170f898bbd0145c --target-service-definition 10202<br>
Please note: The export/import is not an option provided in the HCMX Migration Tool (jar), and there are no APIs available, it’s only available with CLI.</p>
