<html><h2>HCMX Migration CLI</h2>

<p>The HCMX Migration tool provides all the required APIs to migrate CSA/HCM to HCMX. The HCMX Migration CLI script allows you to interact with the Migration Tool APIs providing the CLI experience.<br>
<br>
The HCMX Migration tool needs to be downloaded from the &lt;LINK&gt; Marketplace Portal. Detailed documentation of the migration process can be found &lt;LINK&gt; here. This document describes the CLI tool commands and it's usage.</p>
&nbsp;

<h2>Prerequisite</h2>

<p>This document assumes that you have installed a working HCMX and its supporting components (RAS, UCMDB). Read the migration document to create all the prerequisite configurations (like tenant, LDAP, users, roles) in HCMX, and you have validated the basic set of designs on HCMX from the CSA/HCM instance to ensure they are working without any issues. Once you have completed these, then you are ready to perform the migration.<br>
<br>
The CLI script needs the following Linux library tools on the system, ensure they are installed;<br>
jq, awk, grep, sed, column</p>
&nbsp;

<h2>Installation steps</h2>

<p><br>
The CLI script (hcmxmig) needs to be copied to the 'script' folder in the migration directory, it will run on the same instance where the migration tool is executed. The CLI script needs any Linux environment for it to be installed, so you can either use the CSA/HCM nodes or HCMX nodes or a separate Linux system to deploy the migration tool and CLI script. You would also need a PostgreSQL database for the HCMX Migration tool to run, please check the Tool documentation for the details.<br>
<br>
Extract the migration tool archive to the directory (like hcmxmig) and create a script sub-directory. It should have the following structure;<br>
<br>
|- hcmxmig<br>
|- hcmxmig/hcmx-migration.jar<br>
|- hcmxmig/config/application.properties<br>
|- hcmxmig/script/hcmxmig<br>
<br>
Optionally you can add the hcmxmig CLI into the PATH variable, to do this add the following in the ~/.bash_profile<br>
PATH=$PATH:$HOME/bin:&lt;path&gt;/hcmxmig/script</p>

<h2>HCMX Migration Tool Configuration</h2>

<p><br>
Once the migration tool is extracted, you can use the CLI script to install and configure the migration tool. Refer to the tool configuration section to configure. Follow the steps to configure and start the migration tool;</p>

<ol>
	<li>Configure the source, target URL and its credentials. This will also add the URL certificates into the java trust store automatically, you might be prompted for the truststore password (default is “changeit”). Example:
	<p>hcmxmig tool configure --sourceUrl https://hostname:port/csa --sourceUser admin --sourcePwd password --targetUrl https://hostname/&lt;tenantid&gt;/dnd --targetUser dndadmin --targetPwd password</p>
	</li>
	<li>Configure the Postgresql database for the migration tool, only postgresql is supported. The --certpath is optional and can be used to configure the SSL connection to Postgres.
	<ul>
		<li>To create the database in the postgres, use the following SQL statement after connecting to postgres
		<p>create user hcmxmig login password '2the#moon' inherit;<br>
		create database hcmxmig with owner=hcmxmig;</p>
		</li>
		<li>Configure the migration tool with the database.
		<p>hcmxmig tool configuredb --dbhost hostname --dbport 5432 --dbname hcmx-migration --dbuser postgres --dbpass password --certpath /home/hcmxpgdb.crt</p>
		</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Install the HCMX Migration service. It will prompt you for a keystore generation (if not already done) for the hcmx-migration tool and creates a keystore, installs the 'hcmx-migration' service and starts it. Example
	<p>hcmxmig tool install</p>
	</li>
	<li>Watch the HCMX Migration service status to ensure its running and there no errors, you should see the swagger URL link which would mean the tool has started. Example
	<p>hcmxmig tool status</p>
	</li>
	<li>Login to the HCMX Migration tool, the default password is 'password'. This will saved into the user profile for future user, a token is automatically generated and used for all further API calls. Example
	<p>hcmxmig tool login admin password</p>
	</li>
</ol>
