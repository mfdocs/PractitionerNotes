<html><p>The HCMX DND capability enables customers to create service designs, offerings, and automate the provisioning and management of hybrid and multi-cloud resources. The HCMX DND service designs provide the way to describe the deployment blueprint, and there will be multiple user inputs required in order to fulfill the service design. The user input is defined as options in the "Configuration Options" tab on the service design. The user input property types supported by HCMX are Boolean, Integer, String, and List. With the List input type, there can be a static list that you can define in the option itself or there can be a dynamic list that get populated by executing the JavaScript in DND.</p>
