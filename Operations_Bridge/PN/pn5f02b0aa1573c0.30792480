<h2><span style="color:#000000;"><span style="font-size:11pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri,sans-serif">Customers who are willing to upgrade to the latest version of OpsBridge Suite 2019.11, has to go through multiple (quarterly) upgrades, since there is no direct upgrade supported so far. To avoid the huge effort, time and complexity the aberrant suggestion was to go ahead with a plan to migrate their current environment WITHOUT undergoing multiple HOPS.</span></span><br>
<br>
<span style="font-size:11pt"><span style="line-height:107%"><span style="font-family:Calibri,sans-serif">Customers who are running their PRODUCTION environment in OpsBridge Suite with embedded Postgres and lots of integrations with Operations Agent (incl. Management packs / OpsC) and SiS servers, etc., also need to be preserved for upgrade use case.</span></span></span><br>
<span style="font-size:11pt"><span style="line-height:107%"><span style="font-family:Calibri,sans-serif">This document tries to capture every detailed aspect which needs to be followed to achieve a successful migration, without (or minimal) Configuration DATA loss (from the Postgres side of the house). VERTICA DB (used for COSO) is NOT considered, as there is NO migration plan.</span></span></span></span></h2>

<div class="Admonition_Note"><span style="color:#000000;"><span style="font-size:11pt"><span style="line-height:107%"><span style="font-family:Calibri,sans-serif">Scope of migration: Any OpsBridge suite with embedded Postgres (not less than 2018.11 version) to OpsBridge suite 2019.11 with external Postgres.</span></span></span></span></div>
