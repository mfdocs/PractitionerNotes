  The Micro Focus IT Operations Management Container Deployment Foundation (CDF) powers the deployment of the container based software suites and significantly decreases the overall customer’s time to value.
 </p>
 <p>
  The installation and deployment of ITOM Suites in an IT environment has been traditionally very complex and expensive to setup and operate, involving different IT teams, including infrastructure, network, storage, and virtualization groups as well as additional resources, such as professional services. You would also expect spending additional time for post-deployment activities such as product-to-product integrations, and licensing activities. Upgrades have also been very slow to be adopted with very large regression cycles gated by many environments and processes, impacting final delivery of updates into production.
 </p>
 <p>
  By building a new and agile software delivery platform, alongside a modernized software, the Container Deployment Foundation allows customers to install pre-integrated, feature-rich software suite. Not only Day-1 type of operations have been resolved immediately due to the nature of a container based infrastructure, the same platform allows for easier access and deployment and operation of subsequent upgrades.
 </p>
 <p>
  The distribution unit of the software delivery is container-based, leveraging the speed and format of the new containerized environment. By bundling a fully automated orchestration layer to bootstrap and manage the lifecycle of many suite -related containers, we are able to standardize on the deployment, upgrade and patching, scaling and rollbacks of ITOM Suites while accelerating our software delivery with innovation and quality.
