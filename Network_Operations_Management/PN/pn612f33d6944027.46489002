<html><p>Organizations increasingly rely on intelligent reporting &amp; analytics on top of data spanning multiple sources and domains. To enable this critical function, the NOM suite utilizes the OPTIC Data Lake, a component on the ITOM platform that consolidates the data collection and storage of a high volume of data from various NOM suite components into a common data lake. A detailed white paper introduces the concept of Bring Your Own BI tool (BYOBI), to guide you in building your own reports on top of the OPTIC Data Lake, using example BI tools.</p>
