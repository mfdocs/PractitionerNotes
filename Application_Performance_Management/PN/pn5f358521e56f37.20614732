<html><p>Adobe will stop distributing and updating its <a href="https://www.adobe.com/products/flashplayer/enterprise-end-of-life.html">Flash Player after 31 December 2020</a>, with the major browser vendors removing Adobe Flash support at the same time. Adobe Flash components in software products will no longer function after this date.</p>

<p>Versions of Application Performance Management before 9.51 included some Flash-based components. If you are using a version older than 9.51, upgrade now to keep all APM functionality running after Adobe Flash end-of-life.</p>

</ul>

<p>In addition to new non-Flash functionality, upgrading to 9.5 offers <a href="https://docs.microfocus.com/itom/ITOM:Application_Performance_Management/WhatsNew">additional benefits</a> that help you manage and monitor your applications:&nbsp;</p>
