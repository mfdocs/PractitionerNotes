<html><p>Adobe will stop distributing and updating its&nbsp;<a href="https://www.adobe.com/products/flashplayer/enterprise-end-of-life.html">Flash Player after 31 December 2020</a>, with the major browser vendors removing Adobe Flash support at the same time. Adobe Flash components in software products will no longer function after this date.</p>

<p>Versions of NNMi before 2019.05 Patch 3 included a few Flash-based components. If you are using a version older than 2019.05 Patch 3, upgrade now to keep all NNMi functionality running after Adobe Flash end-of-life. While Patch 3 removes all Flash-based components, as a best practice, use the latest available patch, NNMi 2019.05 Patch 6. NNMi patches are cumulative, so only Patch 6 needs applied to your NNMi 2019.05 installation. After upgrading to NNMi 2019.05, consider upgrading to NNMi <a href="https://docs.microfocus.com/itom/Network_Node_Manager_i:2019.11/ReleaseNotes">2019.11</a>.</p>
