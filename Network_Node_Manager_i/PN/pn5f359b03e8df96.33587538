<html><p>Adobe will stop distributing and updating its&nbsp;<a href="https://www.adobe.com/products/flashplayer/enterprise-end-of-life.html">Flash Player after 31 December 2020</a>, with the major browser vendors removing Adobe Flash support at the same time. Adobe Flash components in software products will no longer function after this date.</p>

<p>Versions of NNMi before 2019.05 Patch 6&nbsp;included a couple of&nbsp;Flash-based features.&nbsp; If you are using a version older than 2019.05 Patch 6, upgrade now to keep all NNMi functionality running after Adobe Flash end-of-life.&nbsp; After upgrading to NNMi 2019.05, consider upgrading to&nbsp;<a href="https://docs.microfocus.com/itom/Network_Node_Manager_i:2020.08/ReleaseNotes">NNMi 2020.08</a>.</p>

	<li>Real Time Graph â€“ An option has been available since NNMi 10.21 which&nbsp;users can select to view non-flash graphs.&nbsp; To completely remove Flash files from the installation, upgrade&nbsp;to 2019.05&nbsp;Patch 6.</li>
	<li>Performance Troubleshooting Console - This functionality was removed in NNMi 2018.11 and flash files were completely removed from the installation in NNMi 2019.05 Patch 6.&nbsp; A non-flash option is now available in NNMi 2020.08 and NNMi 2019.05 Patch 7.</li>
