<p>Business Value Dashboards present your data in a very flexible layout for visualizing on any browser capable device.&nbsp; Within Micro Focus Network Operations Management (NOM) suite, there are several out-of-the-box data sources, such as incidents from Network Node Manager (NNMi) and device configuration and vulnerability from Network Automation (NA).&nbsp; These data sources can be streamed to BVD when integration is enabled.&nbsp;&nbsp; However, the current NOM Suite does not have a built-in performance metrics data sources for BVD.&nbsp; This article will demonstrate how to build a solution to achieve this with a concrete use case.</p>

<p><strong>Use Case Description</strong>:&nbsp; Due to the COVID-19 outbreak, Company A is requesting all its employees to work from home.&nbsp; The company is conducting a network stress test to make sure its network infrastructure is capable of providing sufficient bandwidth.&nbsp; They want to use NOM Suite to perform the test and stream the results to BVD.</p>

<p><strong>Use Case Implementation:</strong> The use story was implemented in the following three steps</p>

<ol>
	<li>Determine the metrics to be collected for the test,</li>
	<li>Configure NNMi to collect these metrics,</li>
	<li>Write a script to retrieve the collected metrics from NNMi NPS and stream them to a BVD dashboard.</li>
</ol>

<p>Details for each steps are described below:</p>
