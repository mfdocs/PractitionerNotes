<p>The Marketplace Connector provides audit policy content to ensure that servers are compliant against a variety of standards such as; PCI, CIS, SOX and HIPAA to name a few.</p>

<p>The provided documentation is not prescriptive enough to enable a successful install as there are several omissions.</p>

<p>Obtaining the connector from the portal:&nbsp;<a href="https://marketplace.microfocus.com/itom/content/marketplace-connector-mpc">https://marketplace.microfocus.com/itom/content/marketplace-connector-mpc</a>&nbsp;this can be downloaded on a windows system as it contains the Mpc Software and the Documentation inside.</p>

<p>At the time of writing the package downloaded was; Marketplace Connector 1.0.070.zip</p>

<p>The MpC software is not required to be installed into the&nbsp;<strong>/opt/opsware</strong>&nbsp;directory structure. Before it was named MpC it was called LNC (Live Network Connector) and it was located at&nbsp;<strong>/opt/opsware/lnc</strong>. The installation will proceed with it being installed into&nbsp;<strong>/opt</strong></p>

<p>The package&nbsp;<strong>marketplace-connector-1.0.070.zip</strong>&nbsp;will need to be copied to a single SA server. Its recommended that you copy this to the Primary core infrastructure slice. Copy this package to&nbsp;<strong>/opt</strong>&nbsp;on the MMCENTRAL server and decompress.</p>

<pre># cd /opt
# unzip marketplace-connector-1.0.070.zip

<p>There are several pieces of information that are going to be required for the installation</p>

<ul>
	<li>SA Username / Password</li>
	<li>MpC Username / Password</li>
</ul>

<p>The configuration of MpC should be done via the marketplace-connector.sh script, to save time we can setup the following file with this content and then supply the credentials as a secondary step.</p>

<p>config/user-prefs.conf</p>

<pre>cbtpath=/opt/opsware/cbt/bin/cbt
cbtconfpath=/opt/marketplace-connector/config/cbt.conf
product=sas
productdir=/opt/opsware
stream=cc_library_py3,ec_cis_rhel
service=security
productuser=admin
url=https\://marketplace.microfocus.com</pre>

<p>If you want to setup this file the documented way you would need to run the following</p>

<pre>./marketplace-connector.sh write-config --setting=cbtpath=/opt/opsware/cbt/bin/cbt
./marketplace-connector.sh write-config --setting=cbtconfpath=/opt/marketplace-connector/config/cbt.conf
./marketplace-connector.sh write-config --setting=product=sas
./marketplace-connector.sh write-config --setting=productdir=/opt/opsware
./marketplace-connector.sh write-config --url=https://marketplace.microfocus.com
./marketplace-connector.sh write-config --setting=security.cc_library_py3
./marketplace-connector.sh write-config --setting=security.ec_cis_rhel</pre>

<p><img alt="/!\" height="16" src="http://wiki.local/moin_static1910/modernized/img/alert.png" title="/!\" width="16">&nbsp;It's very important that&nbsp;<tt>cc_library_py3</tt>&nbsp;appear first as there are dependencies on this stream and it must be imported before others.</p>

<p>It's advisable that you start with only 1 stream to ensure that all credentials are correct and the process is working before adding more streams.</p>

<p>Setting up the credentials will encrypt the passwords. The first configuration is to authenticate against the marketplace to download content.</p>

<pre>[root@sa1080ct8c1 marketplace-connector]# ./marketplace-connector.sh write-config --username=BrettEngland
Please enter password for user BrettEngland :</pre>

<p>The second authentication is to allow MpC to login to SA for the purpose of creating Audit Policy objects. Its recommended that you use the admin username. The password for this user can be found like this:</p>

<pre>[root@sa1080ct8c1 marketplace-connector]# fgrep -A1 detuser /var/opt/opsware/install_opsware/resp/resp_globals
%truth.detuserpwd
opsware_admin</pre>

<p>Setup SA authentication</p>

<pre>[root@sa1080ct8c1 marketplace-connector]# ./marketplace-connector.sh write-config --setting=productuser=admin
Please enter password for user admin :</pre>

<p>The content is downloaded from MpC and imported using CBT this requires that we set up a configuration file with the same admin user credentials</p>

<pre># cat &lt;&lt;EOF &gt;/opt/marketplace-connector/config/cbt.conf
twist.password=opsware_admin
spike.password=opsware_admin
cbt.security.obfuscatePasswords=true
EOF</pre>

<p>The cleartext passwords in this file will be encrypted when accessed.</p>

<p>Downloading and importing of content can proceed</p>

<pre>./marketplace-connector.sh</pre>

<p>There are many ways in which this can fail</p>

<ul>
	<li>MpC authenticate was incorrect</li>
	<li>SA user credentials are incorrect</li>
	<li>CBT Credentials are incorrect</li>
</ul>

<p>If any of these events occur it's not enough to correct the credentials and restart the process as MpC remembers what it has done. In these circumstances, you must perform a reset</p>

<pre>rm -rf /opt/marketplace-connector/cache
rm /opt/marketplace-connector/config/downloadStatus.csv</pre>

<p>If the import was a success you can proceed to include additional streams</p>

<pre>./marketplace-connector.sh list-streams</pre>

<p>Make choices and include them for downloading</p>

<pre>./marketplace-connector.sh write-config --setting=security.cc_pci_unix</pre>

<h2 id="About_Python_3">About Python 3</h2>

<p>The audit content is now being delivered as Python 3 code.</p>

<p>The version of python used by the Agents varies by SA release.</p>

<ul>
	<li>SA 2020.11 - Python 3.8.5</li>
	<li>All other SA releases - Python 2.7.10</li>
</ul>

<p>This will require SA agents using Python 2 to have the SIX compatibility module. This module allows the execution of Python 3 code with a Python 2 interpreter. This was only introduced in later SA agents versions and may require an Agent upgrade for it to be available.</p>

<p>Minimum agent version</p>

<ul>
	<li>
	<p>2018.08 : Agents &gt; internal build 80417</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>SA 10.60 : Agents &gt; internal build 80560</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>SA 10.50 : Agents &gt; internal build 81122</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>SA 10.23 : Agents &gt; internal build 81536</p>
	</li>
</ul>

<p>The minimum agent packs for py3 compatibility</p>

<ul>
	<li>
	<p><a href="https://community.microfocus.com/t5/Server-Automation-User/Python-2-amp-3-compatibility/m-p/1769921">https://community.microfocus.com/t5/Server-Automation-User/Python-2-amp-3-compatibility/m-p/1769921</a></p>
	</li>
</ul>

<p>Those build numbers are the SVN check-in points when the PY3 six-module was merged to those branches.</p>

<p>For example for 2018.08. The below does not have the SIX module</p>

<ul>
	<li>opsware-agent-75.0.79005.0-linux-7SERVER-X86_64</li>
</ul>

<p>This will work:</p>

<ul>
	<li>opsware-agent-75.0.85351.0-linux-7SERVER-X86_64</li>
</ul>
