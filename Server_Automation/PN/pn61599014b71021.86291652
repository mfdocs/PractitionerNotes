<html>The Twist JVM uses Garbage First (G1) garbage collection algorithm. When Twist is configured with large Java heaps (8GB or above) and the default G1 configuration, the garbagge collection struggles to keep up with the application allocation rates under heavy load. This results in Full GC events that usually pause the application threads for longer than the target pause time of 1000ms. When G1 algorithm is used, Full GC events should be avoided as much as possible.</html>
