<h1>Device group tuning</h1>

<p>Dynamic device groups tuning is not as simple as tweaking a configuration parameter.&nbsp;The reporting threshold for long running dynamic device group calculations is 10 seconds and any taking longer than this will be reported in the twist <strong>server.log</strong> file.&nbsp; &nbsp;Concentrating on those taking minutes would be prudent.&nbsp; Having said that you can also suffer a death by a thousand little cuts. From the twist logs.</p>

<pre>2018-06-21 00:59:16,111 WARNING Thread-26 [com.opsware.twist.utils.SQLHelper] [checkForElapsedTimeWarning] SQL elapsed time (114.945 seconds) exceeds warning threshold (10 seconds)
java.sql.SQLException: SQL was successful but the elapsed time threshold was exceeded</pre>

<p>Some device groups take longer than others to compute due to their complexity. Resolving DDG issues is not an exact science, it a black art, and some guidance is necessary.</p>

<p>There are some thing you can do:</p>

<h2>Delete DDG’s that are orphaned and not being reference by any policy</h2>

<p>These are being recalculated unnecessarily and are performing no purpose in the system except to chew up CPU and I/O time.</p>

<p>There is a support tool that allows you to locate orphaned device groups, that is groups without usage.&nbsp;Snippet from the man page.</p>

<pre>DESCRIPTION
       dgUsage  is  a recursive Device Group listing program that produces output
       to indicate if a Device Group is being referenced or not.
       A device group that only contains servers and it’s not referenced is marked
       as an ORPHAN otherwise its marked as USED.</pre>

<p>For the full man page source the support tools setup and use “man” like you would any other UNIX tool.</p>

<pre># . /opt/opsware/support/setup.sh
# man dgUsage</pre>

<p>It can be used like this (This may take a while):</p>

<pre># dgUsage Public
Public - USED
Public/200 Servers - ORPHAN
Public/8bit Device Group Name - ORPHAN
Public/two Servers - USED
Public/OEL Servers - USED
Public/Restricted Access - USED
Public/Fake Servers - ORPHAN</pre>

<p>those orphaned can be examined closer before deciding to remove them. Delete can be an individual</p>

<pre># dgUsage --remove "Public/Fake Servers"</pre>

<p>or en-mass by supplying a root folder.&nbsp; It does not have to be top level root folder Public this is just an example,&nbsp;</p>

<pre># dgUsage --remove Public</pre>

<h2>Locate the long running (high cost) dynamic device groups</h2>

<p>There are a couple of ways you can do this:</p>

<ul>
	<li>
	<p>The debug logging shows how long each membership calculation took and the SQL used. This helps identify the most time consuming group calculation and condition for that group. To turn on this logging, add the two lines below to&nbsp;<tt>/etc/opt/opsware/twist/twist_custom.conf</tt>.</p>
	</li>
</ul>

<pre>recalc.debugTiming=true
com.opsware.device.impl.level=FINER</pre>

<p>You can see the output in&nbsp;<tt>/var/log/opsware/twist/server.log.&lt;0-9&gt;</tt>. The following script finds most time consuming group calculation.</p>

<pre>cd /var/log/opsware/twist
egrep 'Ending pullAndRecalcAnEvent' `ls -1tr server.log.?` | sed -e 's/FINE.* //' -e 's/\]//' | sort -n | awk '$NF &gt; 30000 { print }' &gt; /tmp/bad-times.input</pre>

<ul>
	<li>Gather an Oracle AWR report and look for SQL statements involving Dynamic Device Group recalculations. Encoded into the SQL will be an Object ID that can be used to trace back to the Device Group that generated SQL.
	<ul>
		<li>ref: QCCR1D176272 - Tracking down performance issue for Dynamic Device Group Recalc is hard from just an Oracle AWR report</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
</ul>

<p>In the Oracle AWR report the SQL will have a comment like this&nbsp;<tt>/*&nbsp;Recalc.17.5330001&nbsp;*/</tt>&nbsp;where the last number is the ID of the DDG running. You may also see&nbsp;<tt>Recalc.20.999999</tt>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<tt>Recalc.40.999999</tt>&nbsp;any SQL adorned with a Recalc comment is related to device group recalculations.</p>

<pre>SELECT /* Recalc.17.5330001 */ DISTINCT d.dvc_id, 'd' as dvc_type FROM  (select /* ResourceTypeView.01 */ devices.* from truth.devices where devices.DVC_ID in ((((((select /* RA.device_base_view */ distinct devices.dvc_id from   (select /* RA.device_svgname_ivw */ device_role_classes.dvc_id as dvc_id, rc.role_class_short_name as device_servergroup_name,  --- snip ---</pre>

<p>You can see what Device Group this is using a support tool:</p>

<pre># /opt/opsware/bin/support/dgDump 5330001
role_class_id: 5330001
role_class_full_name: Device Groups Public qc176272
role_class_short_name: qc176272
created_by: brett
created_dt: 20131125T01:36:29
modified_by: : brett
modified_dt: : 20131125T01:58:02
parent_role_class_id: 3390001
rule: ((device_agent_status IN ('UNREACHABLE', 'OK')))</pre>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Tune the DDG query</h2>

<ul>
	<li>Minimize the usage of the keyword operators; IN, BEGINS_WITH, CONTAINS and NOT_IN and always prefer EQUALS.</li>
	<li>Do not duplicate high cost sub-rules.</li>
</ul>

<p>If the same high cost sub-rule is present in multiple device groups it will be executed on the DB multiple times when its recalc event is processed. Isolating the high cost rules into their separate device groups is the recommended approach.</p>

<p>Consider these two device group both with an expensive CONTAINS clause:</p>

<pre>            group_1: (Facility Name Equals "SA10A") &amp; (Installed Software CONTAINS "HP")
            group_2: (Facility Name Equals "SA10B") &amp; (Installed Software CONTAINS "HP")</pre>

<p>The&nbsp;<tt>CONTAINS&nbsp;"HP"</tt>&nbsp;high cost query is executed twice for group_1 and group_2.</p>

<p>This would be better. We have isolated this to its own device group and then referenced it from the others.</p>

<pre>            group_HP: (Installed Software CONTAINS "HP")
            group_1: (Facility Name Equals "SA10A") &amp; (Device Group Is "group_HP")
            group_2: (Facility Name Equals "SA10B") &amp; (Device Group Is "group_HP")</pre>
