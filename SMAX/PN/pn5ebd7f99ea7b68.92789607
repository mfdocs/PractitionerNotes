<html>Every record type in SMAX has a pre-defined set of forms which the system uses when displaying information. The specific form (or sometimes forms) shown to the may depend on what phase of workflow the records is currently in or what action the user is taking. It is not possible to create new forms. This restriction ensures a common look and behavior for all records of a certain type, leading to increased productivity for the end user as the fields are always in the same place for each record.<br>
<br>
While SMAX does not allow the creation of new forms, there are several methods available to customize a form based on specific requirements. The two primary methods involve business rules and models.
<h2>Business Rules</h2>
<br>
There are several business rule templates available that allow modifications to a form based on defined conditions. Which rule to use depends on the type of change you are trying to make. These rules include:
<ul>
	<li>Disabling a field</li>
	<li>Expanding a section</li>
	<li>Hiding a field</li>
	<li>Hiding a section</li>
	<li>Hiding a tab</li>
	<li>Restricting/allowing editing of fields</li>
</ul>
<br>
Using the business rules, a common form can be modified based on criteria such as the current phase of the record, the model used, or any other information stored in the record itself. While there are too many examples of using the business rules to list here, the following represents some of the more common use cases.<br>
&nbsp;
<h3>Hiding sections based on phase</h3>
In the Change process, there is often different information needed at different times in the process. For example, there is specific information needed during the Review step of the process that is not meaningful for the earlier phases of the change. Here, the Hiding a section rule can be used to hide this information until needed.<br>

<br>
Note that a separate rule is used for the preview, full, and the calendar preview forms.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Once this rule is in place, the Review section is not visible in the early phases of the change:<br>

but is visible for Changes that have reached the Review phase.<br>
