As we progress through the guide, we will investigate how the different record types in Service Management Automation X&nbsp;are related, building up to a complete data model. This will provide a useful way to see how all the different modules interact with each other. The final data model is represented in the following diagram:</p>

<p>In our Data Model, each box is color-coded. These colors represent the <strong>badge color</strong> for records of that type within SMAX. The color families also help to visualize the overall modules that certain collections of records create.</p>

<h3>Core Data</h3>

<p>Putting the Core Data record types into our data model is a bit problematic, as they relate in some way to almost every other record type in the system. Instead of drawing all of those lines and making our model unreadable, here we present a simplified data model showing only the relationships between these objects.</p>

<div>
<div><img alt="XCoreData.gif" src="/mediawiki/images/3/3b/XCoreData.gif" style="height:210px; width:436px"></div>
</div>

<p><br>
Note the icons for Person, Location, Entitlement Rule, Time period and Group. On our data models from here on out we will add these icons to any boxes that have relationships to each type. For example, Incident records reference several types of Core Data, giving the following representation:</p>

<div>
<div><img alt="IncidentExample.gif" src="/mediawiki/images/d/d6/IncidentExample.gif" style="height:81px; width:124px"></div>
</div>

<p><br>
In this way, the icons show that the Incident has relationships to Person, Group, and Location.</p>

<p>In addition, in the full Data Model diagram, links to the Expense Line record type are represented by a dollar sign ($). A separate Data Model for Expense Lines is included in this section to show specific relationships to that record type.</p>

<h3>ITIL Record Types</h3>

<p>To further simplify the Data Model diagram, the ITIL record types are combined into distinct groups when two or more record types share the same relationships. There are three groupings:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Blue: All ITIL record types (request, incident, problem, change, and release)</li>
	<li>Orange: request and incident</li>
	<li>Light Green: change and release</li>
</ul>

<p>When a relationship connects to or from one of these group boxes, it represents a relationship to all record types within that box. In the example below we can infer relationships between:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Change relates to one ore more requests and change relates to one or more incidents</li>
	<li>Both change and release related to one or more incidents</li>
</ul>

<h3>Full Data Model</h3>

<p>Dotted lines represent a virtual relationship between record types. There is no physical relationship in the database structure, but there is a relationship between the record types that is defined in SMAX's application code.</p>

<p>The complete Data Model follows:</p>
