In this chapter, we will look at the knowledge management process. Knowledge management allows the IT department to gather, analyze, store and share information about its provided services. The primary purpose of the process is to improve efficiency by reducing the need to rediscover information that is already known in some part of the organization.
</p>
Knowledge articles may be related to many of the other primary IT processes. Articles can be created from these other processes, as well as used to assist in the resolution of these processes as well.<div class="center"><div class="floatnone"><a onclick="javascript:loadingImage(this);" class="image"><img alt="KnowledgeDataModel.gif" src="/mediawiki/images/1/11/KnowledgeDataModel.gif" width="448" height="549" data-file-width="448" data-file-height="549"></a></div></div></div>

<p>In a perfect world, a service desk agent would never have to figure out the solution to a specific issue or answer a question more than once. While we don’t live in a perfect world, we can do our best to capture all of our knowledge for use by both our agents and end users.
</p><p>While everything in Service Management Automation X is knowledge of some form or another, knowledge management allows us to create and maintain a curated database of knowledge articles and news articles for our services. In this way, we can ensure the integrity and quality of our most used pieces of knowledge.
</p><p>After we capture what we know, Service Management Automation X assists our agents and end users by displaying relevant knowledge at key points in the processes they are using. But before we see how the system does this, let’s make sure we understand what this curated database holds and how we add to it.
</p><p>The knowledge management process allows us to create two separate types of knowledge: knowledge articles and news. Articles contain information about a service (or a component of the service) that could help someone either provide the service or consume the service. For a simple example, we might have a knowledge article that describes how to access the company email using a tablet or phone.
</p><p>News, on the other hand, contains alerts or notices about critical issues or temporary changes to a service that users are consuming or providing. For example, we might create a news article for an upcoming outage of the Email service while we are upgrading it. One of the few differences in the article and news records is that the news articles may have a distinct end time after which they are no longer displayed to the users.
</p><p>One thing that is worth mentioning about both types of knowledge is that we can link them to the entitlement rules that we talked about earlier. Therefore you can create knowledge that can only people in a specific group, location, or role can view. This makes it easier to keep all the users from being overloaded with articles that aren’t applicable to their unique situation.
</p><p><br>
</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Creating_New_Knowledge">Creating New Knowledge</span><span class="mw-editsection"><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">[</span><a href="/mediawiki/index.php?title=SMAX:2018.08/PractitionersNotes/GettingStarted/KM&amp;veaction=edit&amp;section=2" class="mw-editsection-visualeditor" title="Edit section: Creating New Knowledge">edit</a><span class="mw-editsection-divider"> | </span><a href="/mediawiki/index.php?title=SMAX:2018.08/PractitionersNotes/GettingStarted/KM&amp;action=edit&amp;section=2" title="Edit section: Creating New Knowledge">edit source</a><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">]</span></span></h2>
<p>We have a few choices for creating new knowledge. As I mentioned earlier, one of the first things we might want to do is to import some of the knowledge we already have in our organization. But what about when we want to create new articles, or there is an upcoming event we want to create a news article for?
</p><p>One option we have is to start from scratch by creating a new article through the Service Management Automation X menu option. Then fill out the information and save the record to start the process workflow (more on that in a second). However, most times the Knowledge we want to add results from working on a customer issue or implementing a specific change to the system.
</p><p>In that case, we can create the Article or News directly from the process we are working on — it can be an incident, a change, or most other process type records. We simply open the 'More' menu on the top of the screen and select 'Create article from record' or 'Create news from record'. This will take us to the correct screen to create the new knowledge, with relevant information from the original record already filled in. I find this a much better starting point than a blank screen, but you can use whichever method suits you best.
</p><p><br>
</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Models">Models</span><span class="mw-editsection"><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">[</span><a href="/mediawiki/index.php?title=SMAX:2018.08/PractitionersNotes/GettingStarted/KM&amp;veaction=edit&amp;section=3" class="mw-editsection-visualeditor" title="Edit section: Models">edit</a><span class="mw-editsection-divider"> | </span><a href="/mediawiki/index.php?title=SMAX:2018.08/PractitionersNotes/GettingStarted/KM&amp;action=edit&amp;section=3" title="Edit section: Models">edit source</a><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">]</span></span></h2>
<p>When we create new articles, we want to have consistency between similar types. By which I mean all of our FAQs should look the same, all of our service disruption news articles should look the same, etc.
</p><p>To help with this, Service Management Automation X provides article models that we can use when creating a new article. We can set up as many models as we would like and create a common template for the look and feel of that article type.
</p><p><br>
</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Localization">Localization</span><span class="mw-editsection"><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">[</span><a href="/mediawiki/index.php?title=SMAX:2018.08/PractitionersNotes/GettingStarted/KM&amp;veaction=edit&amp;section=4" class="mw-editsection-visualeditor" title="Edit section: Localization">edit</a><span class="mw-editsection-divider"> | </span><a href="/mediawiki/index.php?title=SMAX:2018.08/PractitionersNotes/GettingStarted/KM&amp;action=edit&amp;section=4" title="Edit section: Localization">edit source</a><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">]</span></span></h2>
<p>Since we support multiple languages within our company, we will have to ensure that these articles are available in all of these languages. Service Management Automation X provides functionality that lets us export our articles so we can send them off for localization. Once our localizers complete their task, they send us back the files they have created and we can load them right back into SMAX.&nbsp;
</p><p>Now when our end users perform searches and view articles, they will see them in their own language.
</p><p><br>

<p>Just like any other process in Service Management Automation X, the Knowledge process has a unique workflow that our knowledge contributors will follow. This workflow comprises four distinct steps.
</p><p><a onclick="javascript:loadingImage(this);" class="image"><img alt="9.1-KnowledgeWorkflow.png" src="/mediawiki/images/e/e3/9.1-KnowledgeWorkflow.png" width="1024" height="438" data-file-width="1024" data-file-height="438"></a>

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Creation">Creation</span><span class="mw-editsection"><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">[</span><a href="/mediawiki/index.php?title=SMAX:2018.08/PractitionersNotes/GettingStarted/KM&amp;veaction=edit&amp;section=6" class="mw-editsection-visualeditor" title="Edit section: Creation">edit</a><span class="mw-editsection-divider"> | </span><a href="/mediawiki/index.php?title=SMAX:2018.08/PractitionersNotes/GettingStarted/KM&amp;action=edit&amp;section=6" title="Edit section: Creation">edit source</a><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">]</span></span></h3>
<p>We talked about how we can start the knowledge process, which begins in the 'Draft' phase of the 'Creation' step. As the knowledge contributor, this is where I will create the title and content of the article — which is what our agents and end users will see. For the content, I can use all the rich text components I might need, including links, images, and tables.
</p><p>I also need to specify the service this knowledge applies to. Using the service, we can better present the users with relevant information.
</p><p>Once we create the content, we can move the article into the 'Publication' step.
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Publication">Publication</span><span class="mw-editsection"><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">[</span><a href="/mediawiki/index.php?title=SMAX:2018.08/PractitionersNotes/GettingStarted/KM&amp;veaction=edit&amp;section=7" class="mw-editsection-visualeditor" title="Edit section: Publication">edit</a><span class="mw-editsection-divider"> | </span><a href="/mediawiki/index.php?title=SMAX:2018.08/PractitionersNotes/GettingStarted/KM&amp;action=edit&amp;section=7" title="Edit section: Publication">edit source</a><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">]</span></span></h3>
<p>In the first phase of the 'Publication' step, we can set specific users or groups to be reviewers for our article. Fittingly enough, this is called the 'Review' phase. Service Management Automation X will automatically email the reviewers letting them know we want their feedback on our article.
</p><p>The reviewers can leave their comments on the article in the discussions section. We haven’t talked about discussions yet, but this is where multiple users can have, well, discussions about the record in question.
</p><p><a onclick="javascript:loadingImage(this);" class="image"><img alt="9.2-Discussions.png" src="/mediawiki/images/5/57/9.2-Discussions.png" width="1572" height="887" data-file-width="1572" data-file-height="887"></a>
</p><p>There’s quite a lot of useful functionality in the discussions tab, which we’ll get to later. If you are eager to discover more head over to the <a href="./itom/SMAX:2018.08/1000_GettingStarted/gsDiscussions" title="SMAX:2018.08/1000 GettingStarted/gsDiscussions">discussions page</a> in the online help.
</p><p>Once our knowledge contributor has finished incorporating the reviewers’ comments into the article, they can move it into the 'Publish' phase.
</p><p>In the 'Publish' phase, the knowledge manager makes one last review of the content and adds any necessary information to the article such as the date it should first become available. At this point, the article is ready to be published and consumed by our users, but there is one last important decision the knowledge manager has to make — to publish the article as an internal or external one.
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Consumption">Consumption</span><span class="mw-editsection"><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">[</span><a href="/mediawiki/index.php?title=SMAX:2018.08/PractitionersNotes/GettingStarted/KM&amp;veaction=edit&amp;section=8" class="mw-editsection-visualeditor" title="Edit section: Consumption">edit</a><span class="mw-editsection-divider"> | </span><a href="/mediawiki/index.php?title=SMAX:2018.08/PractitionersNotes/GettingStarted/KM&amp;action=edit&amp;section=8" title="Edit section: Consumption">edit source</a><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">]</span></span></h3>
<p>Articles in the 'Consumption' phase are now available for user searches or automatic news displays. There are two ways that the article can be consumed, internally or externally, as determined by the action our knowledge manager took at the end of the 'Publish' step. Each of these is represented as separate phases in the 'Consumption' step ('Internal' and 'External').
</p><p>Internal articles are only available to our agents, which you’ll remember are the actual behind-the-lines IT personnel (for the most part anyway). Publishing articles internally is meant for those bits of information that either assist the agents in providing a specific service (or part of a service), or perhaps some information on how to consume a specific service (or part of) that might be too technical (or messy) for the end user to tackle on their own.
</p><p>External articles are available to both our agents and the end users. End users will consume this knowledge through the Service Management Automation Service Portal.
</p><p>So just remember that external articles are available to everyone (everyone who fits the entitlement requirements anyway), while internal articles are only available to our agents.
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Retirement">Retirement</span><span class="mw-editsection"><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">[</span><a href="/mediawiki/index.php?title=SMAX:2018.08/PractitionersNotes/GettingStarted/KM&amp;veaction=edit&amp;section=9" class="mw-editsection-visualeditor" title="Edit section: Retirement">edit</a><span class="mw-editsection-divider"> | </span><a href="/mediawiki/index.php?title=SMAX:2018.08/PractitionersNotes/GettingStarted/KM&amp;action=edit&amp;section=9" title="Edit section: Retirement">edit source</a><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">]</span></span></h3>
<p>When a knowledge or news article has outlived its usefulness it is archived (which is the only phase of the 'Retirement' step). Archived knowledge does not show up for any user searches for articles or automatic displays of news. Instead of being deleted, however, the article remains archived — where an agent can "reopen" it by moving it back into the draft step, restarting the entire process.
</p><p><br>
</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Using_Knowledge_in_Service_Management_Automation_X">Using Knowledge in Service Management Automation X</span><span class="mw-editsection"><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">[</span><a href="/mediawiki/index.php?title=SMAX:2018.08/PractitionersNotes/GettingStarted/KM&amp;veaction=edit&amp;section=10" class="mw-editsection-visualeditor" title="Edit section: Using Knowledge in Service Management Automation X">edit</a><span class="mw-editsection-divider"> | </span><a href="/mediawiki/index.php?title=SMAX:2018.08/PractitionersNotes/GettingStarted/KM&amp;action=edit&amp;section=10" title="Edit section: Using Knowledge in Service Management Automation X">edit source</a><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">]</span></span></h2>
<p>Putting all of our Knowledge into Service Management Automation X won't make a difference if our users don’t see it. Thankfully, the system provides multiple ways of accessing and presenting this Knowledge. Many of these methods are even baked directly into the process flow, so our users can take advantage of our information without having to go out of their way to find it.
</p><p>Let’s take a look at how the system presents users with knowledge in different situations.
</p><p><br>
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="News_Articles_in_the_Service_Management_Automation_Service_Portal">News Articles in the Service Management Automation Service Portal</span><span class="mw-editsection"><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">[</span><a href="/mediawiki/index.php?title=SMAX:2018.08/PractitionersNotes/GettingStarted/KM&amp;veaction=edit&amp;section=11" class="mw-editsection-visualeditor" title="Edit section: News Articles in the Service Management Automation Service Portal">edit</a><span class="mw-editsection-divider"> | </span><a href="/mediawiki/index.php?title=SMAX:2018.08/PractitionersNotes/GettingStarted/KM&amp;action=edit&amp;section=11" title="Edit section: News Articles in the Service Management Automation Service Portal">edit source</a><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">]</span></span></h3>
<p>When an end user logs on to the Service Portal, important news articles are immediately provided on the right-hand side of the interface.
</p><p><a onclick="javascript:loadingImage(this);" class="image"><img alt="4.2-Portal.png" src="/mediawiki/images/8/87/4.2-Portal.png" width="1444" height="888" data-file-width="1444" data-file-height="888"></a>
</p><p>This is a great way for us to reduce the number of requests our agents have to handle by eliminating reports for planned or known issues that are currently happening. If one of our users logged in to report the internal company web page is down, they might see a news article explaining that it is down for maintenance. While it might not seem like much, the fact that we won’t need to have an agent respond to that question is a great thing. Especially when you consider that this might happen to a great number of users, we are making our agents more efficient by keeping new requests from being opened unnecessarily.
</p><p><br>
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Searching_in_the_Service_Management_Automation_Service_Portal">Searching in the Service Management Automation Service Portal</span><span class="mw-editsection"><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">[</span><a href="/mediawiki/index.php?title=SMAX:2018.08/PractitionersNotes/GettingStarted/KM&amp;veaction=edit&amp;section=12" class="mw-editsection-visualeditor" title="Edit section: Searching in the Service Management Automation Service Portal">edit</a><span class="mw-editsection-divider"> | </span><a href="/mediawiki/index.php?title=SMAX:2018.08/PractitionersNotes/GettingStarted/KM&amp;action=edit&amp;section=12" title="Edit section: Searching in the Service Management Automation Service Portal">edit source</a><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">]</span></span></h3>
<p>When the end user makes a search from the Service Management Automation Service Portal, the system will present them with relevant articles from our knowledge database. Remember how I said knowledge is more than just our knowledge articles though? Here the system might also present relevant service offerings that might solve an end user's issue.
</p><p><a onclick="javascript:loadingImage(this);" class="image"><img alt="9.3-articleSearch.png" src="/mediawiki/images/d/dd/9.3-articleSearch.png" width="1571" height="899" data-file-width="1571" data-file-height="899"></a>
</p><p>The system provides everything in a single list, making it easier for the end user to find what they are looking for. Here you can see that the system returned knowledge articles, but it also returned offerings and a user question (an extension of the knowledge application we’ll look at later) that the user might find helpful. If the end user selects an article, they will view it in its entirety (including any embedded images and video). If they instead select an offering, Service Management Automation X will walk them through the requesting process.
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Using_Live_Support">Using Live Support</span><span class="mw-editsection"><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">[</span><a href="/mediawiki/index.php?title=SMAX:2018.08/PractitionersNotes/GettingStarted/KM&amp;veaction=edit&amp;section=13" class="mw-editsection-visualeditor" title="Edit section: Using Live Support">edit</a><span class="mw-editsection-divider"> | </span><a href="/mediawiki/index.php?title=SMAX:2018.08/PractitionersNotes/GettingStarted/KM&amp;action=edit&amp;section=13" title="Edit section: Using Live Support">edit source</a><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">]</span></span></h3>
<p>When the agent types a caller’s question or request on the 'Live Support' screen, Service Management Automation X checks for related information — including knowledge articles and news. The agent can bring up the articles by selecting the 'Suggested Solutions' box, which shows the number of related articles that the system found.
</p><p>If the agent finds an article that solves the caller’s issue, they can click the 'Propose as solution' button. This will fill out the solution and link the request and the knowledge article.
</p><p>You’ll be quick to notice that Service Management Automation X is again searching additional types of knowledge. We’ll take a look at that when we check out the 'Live Support' page in more detail later.
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Working_a_Request_or_Incident">Working a Request or Incident</span><span class="mw-editsection"><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">[</span><a href="/mediawiki/index.php?title=SMAX:2018.08/PractitionersNotes/GettingStarted/KM&amp;veaction=edit&amp;section=14" class="mw-editsection-visualeditor" title="Edit section: Working a Request or Incident">edit</a><span class="mw-editsection-divider"> | </span><a href="/mediawiki/index.php?title=SMAX:2018.08/PractitionersNotes/GettingStarted/KM&amp;action=edit&amp;section=14" title="Edit section: Working a Request or Incident">edit source</a><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">]</span></span></h3>
<p>If one of our agents is working on a request or incident through the standard interface, they can still take advantage of knowledge directly. At the bottom of the 'Resolution' section is a 'Suggested solutions' tab. Clicking on this tab brings up the most likely knowledge candidates. This knowledge might be more than just articles (i.e. incidents, changes, etc.), but the knowledge articles are always available.
</p><p><a onclick="javascript:loadingImage(this);" class="image"><img alt="9.4-IncidentSuggestions.png" src="/mediawiki/images/b/bb/9.4-IncidentSuggestions.png" width="1578" height="745" data-file-width="1578" data-file-height="745"></a>
</p><p>Again, the agent can copy a link to the article into the solution field with a single click.
</p><p>Clicking on the 'Find more solutions' button will take the user to the global search, copying the description of the record they are working on. What? You don’t know what global search is? Well, that’s because I haven’t gone over that yet. I was looking for a good time to bring it up and now seems like the right time.

<p>Service Management Automation X’s global search function is accessed by clicking the magnifying glass icon on the top right of the screen. It allows the agent to perform a search on the entire system and then drill down into a specific record.
</p><p>One of the nice features here is the ability to restrict the search to a certain record type. So I can perform a search and only return relevant knowledge articles or news. I can also perform the search while I have another record up, and return to it when I’m done.
</p><p>While I can’t use the global search to fill in the solution information like I could when searching from the request/incident, I can mark a specific article as a 'Favorite'. My favorites are always available when using the 'Live Support' page, so if there is an article I use all the time I can make it a favorite so it will be available during every call. I have saved more time by making the 'How to reboot a computer' article one of my favorites than you could imagine.
</p><p>A few things we may need to remember when using the global search:
</p>
<ul><li>Only the top 30 results will be displayed.</li>
<li>Each item has a relevancy score based on how closely it matches the search criteria. Records that have a very low score will not be displayed.</li></ul>
<p>There are also some powerful ways to enhance the use of the global search tool. While it is too much to go into here if you are interested you can look into:

<p>With the service desk, I think the saying “We don’t know what we don’t know” is very relevant. If we knew every question that our end users would ask, we could create all the right knowledge articles so they could find what they needed without even talking to an agent.
</p><p>While we do our best to put out as much quality knowledge as we can, there are always new types of devices or software that the end users get their hands on that we don’t know about. And sometimes we don’t do the best job of putting together the right knowledge for our own services before we launch them (I know, I was shocked too). So while Service Management Automation X might not look into the future for us to determine what we need to create, it has great tools that can help us point out what knowledge we might miss based on our end users’ needs.

<p>One of the Big Data tools that makes Service Management Automation X so popular is called Hot Topic Analytics. This tool allows us to find patterns in unstructured data such as text descriptions. This powerful tool is used in several places in the product, including knowledge management.
</p><p>We can use the Hot Topic Analytics engine to find common terms in support requests or even user searches. This is a great way to find out new things users are looking for that are not already supported by a service offering or knowledge article.
</p><p><a onclick="javascript:loadingImage(this);" class="image"><img alt="9.5-HotTopics.png" src="/mediawiki/images/8/83/9.5-HotTopics.png" width="1581" height="830" data-file-width="1581" data-file-height="830"></a>
</p><p>Here you can see a Hot Topic “map” that represents common terms used to create new support requests. While the colors are simply there to separate the terms (and look pretty), the size of each colored area represents the number of requests using these terms — which the system also displays numerically.
</p><p>We can add filters to narrow down the request to only analyze those for a specific service, time range, or even just those in a particular phase. We can also type in search terms (in the search box on the top) to narrow down the analysis even more. For example, I could type in “iPhone” and see what kind of requests are coming in related to iPhones, even though we don’t officially support them in any of our services. If I see a huge box labeled “Email”, maybe I need to think about supporting company email on iPhones.
</p><p>You can also click on a colored box to just see the related requests in the list on the right-hand side. Oh, and it’s hard to see in just a screenshot, but in some of the boxes (like the top left in this example), you can see some very faded text behind the main text. If you click on this box, it will show a further breakdown of records in that group.
</p><p><a onclick="javascript:loadingImage(this);" class="image"><img alt="9.6-HotTopicBreakdown.png" src="/mediawiki/images/9/9c/9.6-HotTopicBreakdown.png" width="806" height="613" data-file-width="806" data-file-height="613"></a>
</p><p>One note, sometimes when you break down a category the total number of records in the multiple categories might add up to more than the total shown on the original box you clicked on. That is because a record might belong to more than one box in the Hot Topics Analytics map. Here there might be a record that fit into both of the subdivisions inside of our original box. Just remember that the displayed numbers represent the records that fit in each box, not the total number of records.
</p><p>So how do we use this information? Well, we can investigate specific boxes on the map (and we should focus on the largest boxes first) and see if there is a common question or theme in the included requests. Remember that when we select a box, we will see the requests that fit in that box on the list on the right-hand side of the screen.
</p><p>If I scan that list and see a common theme, I’ll check to see if we have any service offering or knowledge on that theme already (I can search the system using the global search tool without having to leave the Hot Topic Analytics screen to check for this). If we don’t, I can create one or the other from this screen. Check the boxes next to the appropriate requests and click the 'Create Article' or 'Create Support Offering' (you can change this to a service offering during the actual create process if you want). This will take us to the create screen where we can fill in all the information, but notice it automatically filled in what it could from the requests we checked.
</p><p>One time that this would be useful would be after introducing new functionality after an upgrade. If we see a lot of questions about a new feature after we upgrade the HR system (for example), we might want to put out a quick knowledge article about that feature so that the end users can find the answers they need themselves — without our agents having to get involved.
</p><p>What about those cases where an end user can’t find what they are looking for but doesn’t open a request? Well, we can change the Hot Topic Analytics to look at user searches rather than requests.
</p><p><a onclick="javascript:loadingImage(this);" class="image"><img alt="9.7-UserSearches.png" src="/mediawiki/images/1/13/9.7-UserSearches.png" width="1572" height="851" data-file-width="1572" data-file-height="851"></a>
</p><p>This allows us another view of what might be missing from the offerings or knowledge within our system. Just like with requests, I can select one or more searches and quickly create a new knowledge article or offering so that next time the user can resolve their issue by themselves.
</p><p>We will still need our own processes to ensure that our knowledge articles are relevant and up to date. Service Management Automation X can tell us how often certain articles are being used so we can improve or retire those that no one bothers using. We could also review any articles older than a certain date to ensure relevancy.
</p><p>Cool, right? Now we can have a better way to let us know we might have missed something than that one vein on the boss's head that throbs when he's about to scream at us.
</p>

<p>When we use the Hot Topic Analytics feature we don’t want the system to return words that are so common they do not add value to the results. Service Management Automation X provides a list of these words to ignore in a 'stop list' for every supported language in the system.
</p><p>If there are any terms that our company wishes to ignore when using this feature, we simply enter them in this list. Conversely, if there is a common term we want to take into consideration we need to remove it from this list. For example, in our company, we have an internal application named 'ACROSS'. Since “across” is an out-of-the-box stop word, we would get no feedback on how much it is used in searches or requests. Once we remove it, those searches and requests will now be seen in the Hot Topic Analytics feature.
