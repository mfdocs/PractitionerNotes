<h2>Introduction&nbsp;</h2>

<p>When creating an integration to Service Management Automation X with a remote system that has an SSL address, it is possible that the certificate of the remote server must be imported into the trusted keystore file of the On-Premises Bridge (OPB). The cacerts file stores public certificates of root Certificate Authority (CA). If there is a problem with the connection between the OPB and the remote system, check the controller.log file of the OPB for the error defined below. If the error exists, then you may be required to follow the procedure described in this document.</p>

<p><em>javax.net.ssl.SSLHandshakeException: sun.security.validator.ValidatorException: PKIX path building failed: sun.security.provider.certpath.SunCertPathBuilderException: unable to find valid certification path to requested target</em></p>

<h2>Finding the location of the Service Management Automation X OPB controller log</h2>

<p>The default location of the controller.log file is in the <em>C:\Program Files\HP\On-Premises Bridge Agent\product\log\controller</em> directory. Once the log file is located, search the log file for the HandshakeException error. If the error appears, the Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN) will be logged, which will allow you to verify that the endpoint in question was indeed the one that is giving the error.<img alt="OPB Image1.png" src="/mediawiki/images/9/96/OPB_Image1.png" style="height:146px; width:943px"></p>

<h2>Finding the location of the Service Management Automation X OPB trusted keystore</h2>

<p>The default OPB trusted keystore file is named <strong>cacerts</strong> and is located in the <em>C:\Program Files\HP\On-Premises Bridge Agent\product\util\3rd-party\jre\lib\security</em> directory. The OPB has its own file and should not be confused with any other Java installation on the machine.</p>

<p></p>

<h2>Obtaining the certificate of the remote server</h2>

<p>In most cases there is a company created certificate available and the server administrator will be able to send it to you. In cases where this is not available, it is also possible to use a browser (FireFox for example) to export the certificate so that it can be imported into the OPB’s trusted keystore.</p>

<p></p>

<h2>Adding the certificate to the trusted keystore</h2>

<p>The java keytool utility is used to import certificates into the trusted keystore. To run the utility, open a command windows and navigate to C:\Program Files\HP\On-Premises Bridge Agent\product\util\3rd-party\jre\bin directory. The format of the necessary command is as follows:</p>

<p>keytool -import -keystore ..\lib\security\cacerts -alias "new Alias" –file myCert.crt .</p>

<p>In this example the <strong>myCert.crt</strong> file is the certificate of the remote server, <strong>cacerts</strong> is the trusted keystore, and the alias is a label set for the certificate. When prompted for a password, “changeit” is the default.</p>

<pre>C:\Program Files\Micro Focus\On-Premises Bridge Agent\product\util\3rd-party\jre\bin&gt;keytool -import -keystore ..\lib\security\cacerts -alias "new Alias" -file c:\myCert.crt
</pre>

<h2>How to identify if the certificate is present</h2>

<p>Java uses a tool named keytool to list or import any certificates in the trusted keystore file. Using this tool allows you to list all of the certificates that were imported into the keystore. Open a command window and navigate to the <em>C:\Program Files\HP\On-Premises Bridge Agent\product\util\3rd-party\jre\bin</em> directory. Run the keytool while pointing to the cacerts file. Syntax for the command is: <em><strong>keytool –list –v –keystore ..\lib\security\cacerts &gt; c:\contents.txt</strong></em></p>

<pre>C:\Program Files\Micro Focus\On-Premises Bridge Agent\product\util\3rd-party\jre\bin&gt;keytool -list -v -keystore ..\lib\security\cacerts &gt; c:\contents.txt
Enter keystore password:  changeit
</pre>

<p>The default password for the keystore is “changeit”. Once executed, a file named c:\contents.txt will list the entire content of the keystore. It is possible to search through this file in notepad or a similar text editor in order to confirm that the certificate for the remote server to confirm was loaded correctly.</p>
