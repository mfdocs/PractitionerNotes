<html><p>This document contains all the APIs which you can use for Cloud Management, they are mostly the Design and Deploy (DND) APIs.</p>

<h2>Security and Authentication</h2>
All of the APIs can be invoked using a basic authentication header. &nbsp;Since APIs require different roles for authentication, the easiest user to use is one with the DND Administration role. &nbsp;This user will be able to invoke all APIs.

<h2>Common API Headers</h2>
The following headers are used across the APIs for HTTP requests

<table border="1" cellpadding="1" cellspacing="1" style="width: 500px;">
	<tbody>
		<tr>
			<td>Accept</td>
			<td>application/json</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Content-Type</td>
			<td>application/json</td>
		</tr>
	</tbody>
</table>

<h2>Example Used in the Document</h2>
In this document, the use case is being developed using the APIs

<ol>
	<li>A component with a set of 4 properties is being created on the fly</li>
	<li>Resource offerings that the design will use are already available in the system</li>
	<li>The design will include two components, one of which is the component created on the fly</li>
	<li>The design will reference one resource offering</li>
	<li>A simple option model is created for the design to represent the offering in SMAX</li>
	<li>The design is published for SMAX to use</li>
	<li>Later on, the design is removed from the system</li>
</ol>

<h2>Example API Descriptions</h2>
Each API documented below contains the following information:

<ul>
	<li>The required method (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, PATCH)</li>
	<li>The required headers</li>
	<li>The relative URL (relative to the DND base URL)</li>
	<li>Any input body</li>
	<li>Any input query parameters</li>
	<li>Expected response codes for a success</li>
	<li>A sample structure of the response body</li>
</ul>
After the formal usage, specific usage of the API in the context of the running example in this document is shown. Any identifiers that are used across APIs are highlighted.
