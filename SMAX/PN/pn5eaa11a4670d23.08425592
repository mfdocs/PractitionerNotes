<html><h1>Introduction</h1>

<p><in any="" process="" specific=""> </in></p>

<p>When certain sub-types of processes necessitate additional process definition on top of the existing workflow, the SMAX administrator can define specific Model records. These models allow the default workflow to be extended in multiple ways, including:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Adding additional fields, called <b>User options</b></li>
	<li>Adding business rules</li>
	<li>Adding specific tasks during multiple workflow phases</li>
	<li>Setting default values that are set when the model is selected</li>
</ul>

<p></p>

<p>Models are available for the following processes:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Change</li>
	<li>Incident</li>
	<li>Knowledge (Article models)</li>
	<li>Release</li>
	<li>Request (Offerings)</li>
</ul>

<p></p>

<p>The following areas support models, but only for setting supporting information/default fields:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Asset Models</li>
	<li>License Models</li>
</ul>

<p></p>

<p>The administrator can define models in these areas to create a unique flow on top of the existing process workflow. The following example shows how the use of Incident Models can create a specific workflow for Major Incidents inside of the Incident process workflow. Note how the Incident Model allows the additional flow on top of the existing Incident workflow.</p>

<p></p>

<h2>Requirements</h2>

<p>When a Major Incident occurs:</p>

<ol>
	<li>The Impact and Urgency of the Incident should be set automatically</li>
	<li>The Incident should automatically be marked as a Problem candidate.</li>
	<li>The group handling the Incident needs to set up a PDL and open a Bridge line for the Major incident team to communicate with</li>
	<li>The group handling the Incident needs to add the domain experts to the Major incident team</li>
	<li>Notifications should be sent to the PDL whenever a new comment is added to the Incident</li>
	<li>The manager of the group handling the Incident must sign off that the Incident has been resolved successfully</li>
</ol>

<p></p>

<h2>Implementation</h2>

<p>In order to fulfill the requirements, the administrator will create a new Incident Model record named “Major Incident”.</p>

<h3>User Options</h3>

<p>Two user options will be added. One to contain the PDL, and the other to contain the Bridge Code.</p>

<h3>Rules</h3>

<p>A single rule will be added to send an email to the PDL when a new comment is added. This rule should only run if the PDL User option has been filled in.</p>

<p></p>

<h3>Task Plan</h3>

<p>The work to set up the PDL, open the Bridge line, and invite the domain experts will be performed as tasks. Three tasks will be defined for the “Initial support” phase of the Incident. Note that the tasks can either be created as serial (as they are here) or parallel.</p>

<h3>Default Values</h3>

<p>Finally, the default values that will be set when using this model are filled in on the “Default values” section. Note that the User options created earlier are available on this form as well (although it does not make sense to set them here).</p>
