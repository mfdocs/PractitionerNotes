<h2 class="mw-headline" id="Business_Rules">Business Rules</h2>
<p>Do not reference a specific record by Id when creating a business rule. Rules defined using an Id are not “portable” when you transfer the workflow from development to production as the Ids will be different between the two systems. Instead, use a field such as DisplayLabel that will be identical between systems, or use the group_id_by_upn lookup function for groups.

<h2 class="mw-headline" id="Offerings">Offerings</h2>
<p>Service offerings cannot be moved between a development and production system. While creating some offerings in development is a good practice for testing and experimentation, all offerings must eventually be created directly in production.
