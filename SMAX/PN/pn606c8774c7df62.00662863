</strong></samp>
<samp>When you install CDF and a suite, you are required to set selinux to <em>targeted</em> mode in the file /etc/sysconfig/selinux. 
This enables medium-level security settings for the operating system.  
</samp>
<samp>If your ITOM installation hangs or runs into time-outs, start by running the “top” command.

<samp>If you see the process “<em>Setroubleshoot</em>” or “<em>setroubleshootd</em>” at the top of the output, then the corresponding selinux daemon is having issues.  
You may also see that the setroubleshoot daemon's use of resources is causing the <em>fluentd</em>&nbsp;(Docker error logging) service to fail.  Fluentd can then generate an extremely large Ruby proccess, leading to even more failures (such as installation time-outs).

Under some conditions, selinux can go into a loop that consumes large amounts of memory and CPU.  The author has seen 98% of a CPU consumed by a runaway setroubleshoot process.

<samp>If you want some insight into what the daemon is doing, you can do a low-level trace using its Process ID (PID).  You may want to direct the output to a file as shown below:
</samp>
# strace -f -p&nbsp; 144232 -s 255 &gt; /tmp/se_trace

.....
[pid 144232] restart_syscall(&lt;... resuming interrupted poll ...&gt;strace: [ Process PID=144232 runs in 64 bit mode. ]
 &lt;unfinished ...&gt;
[pid 144232] read(12, "", 8192)         = 0
[pid 144232] close(12)                  = 0
[pid 144232] lstat("/var/lib/selinux/<wbr>targeted/active/modules/100/<wbr>openvswitch", {st_mode=S_IFDIR|0700, st_size=44, ...}) = 0
[pid 144232] openat(AT_FDCWD, "/var/lib/selinux/targeted/<wbr>active/modules/100/<wbr>openvswitch", O_RDONLY|O_NONBLOCK|O_CLOEXEC|<wbr>O_DIRECTORY) = 12
[pid 144232] fstat(12, {st_mode=S_IFDIR|0700, st_size=44, ...}) = 0
[pid 144232] getdents64(12, /* 5 entries */, 32768) = 128
[pid 144232] getdents64(12, /* 0 entries */, 32768) = 0
[pid 144232] close(12)                  = 0
[pid 144232] openat(AT_FDCWD, "/var/lib/selinux/targeted/<wbr>active/modules/100/<wbr>openvswitch/cil", O_RDONLY|O_CLOEXEC) = 12
[pid 144232] fstat(12, {st_mode=S_IFREG|0600, st_size=2799, ...}) = 0

<p><samp>In this case, the daemon is rapidly opening files throughout the entire file system, with no obvious objective.</samp></p>

<h2><samp>Some Basic Diagnostics</samp></h2>

<h3>dmesg</h3>

<p><samp>The&nbsp;<em>dmesg</em>&nbsp;command prints out messages from the kernel, including boot and driver messages.&nbsp; Sometimes high-level commands hide information that can be found with low-level commands like this.&nbsp; You may find low-level information such as read/write errors from a failing hard drive</samp></p>

<p></p>

<h3><samp>tail -f /var/log/messages</samp></h3>

<p><font face="monospace">Global system messages go to the file&nbsp;<em>/var/log/messages.&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>Start<wbr>up, cron, authorization, and other messages go here.</font></p>

<p></p>

<h3><samp>df -h</samp></h3>

<p><samp>When you work&nbsp;with systems based on Docker &amp; Kubernetes, there will be a lot of local and nfs-mounted drives.&nbsp; There is often trouble if any drive becomes full or unavailabe.&nbsp; Some log files grow quickly during the download or upload of Docker images.</samp></p>

<p></p>

<p><samp>In the above example, the problem was that /dev/mapper/cl-root had quickly grown to 100% during a SMAX download with verification turned on.&nbsp; </samp></p>

<p><samp>The solution was:</samp></p>

<p><samp>1. Clean up the partial download</samp></p>

<p><samp>2. Move all files from the sparsely populated /home folder to free up the /dev/mapper/cl-home drive.&nbsp; Temporarily put those files in /oldhome</samp></p>

<p><samp>3. Delete the /dev/mapper/cl-home drive</samp></p>

<p><samp>4. Remove the /home mapping in /etc/fstab</samp></p>

<p><samp>4. Grow the /dev/mapper/cl-home folder to use the space formerly in /dev/mapper/cl-home</samp></p>

<p><samp>5. Reboot</samp></p>

<p><samp>6. Restore the files from /oldhome to /home</samp></p>
