</p><p><br>
Glenn is the newly appointed administrator for a new implementation of the Micro Focus Service Management Automation X (SMAX) product at his company, ACME Products Inc. ACME provides widgets for many other companies and handles shipping them worldwide from a number of locations.
</p><p><br>
ACME has grown over the years, and the number of systems it needs to ensure the delivery of its widgets has grown as well. Additionally, the company has invested in internal products to help it run smoothly. This growth has resulted in the need for IT to run in an agile and streamlined manner, which was one of the biggest reasons for ACME to go with SMAX.
</p><p><br>
Join us as we follow the implementation process that Glenn uses to get Service Management Automation X up and running. We will document how the system is designed to meet the continuing demands of the company to provide the best service to their customers.
</p><p><br>
We will be focusing on the decisions that Glenn makes that result in a quick and efficient implementation. This involves an iterative approach to problem-solving and delivering value quickly, then circling back and adding additional value and deeper process definitions. We can watch as the system evolves over time from simple call center processes to a fully functional service desk that includes all facets of IT management (and possibly beyond).
