<h2 class="mw-headline" id="Introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>When process driven records (such as requests or incidents) are created in Service Management Automation X, it is often desirable to automatically assign them to a specific group based on information contained in the record. In other cases, it may not be possible to assign the record to a specific group, but instead, the system can provide the agent with a list of suggestions again based on information in the record. Both of these methods are accomplished using business rules.</p>

<p>There are two Rule Types that are commonly used to automatically set the initial group in a record:</p>

<p>• Set field</p>

<p>• Set field based on routing definition</p>

<p>Both rules are used in the ‘After change’ section of the rules.</p>

<p><b>Note:</b> The most common groups that are seen in auto-assignment are service desk group and expert group (for requests and incidents). However, the use cases and examples seen in this section may be used for any group field in a record. Simply specify the proper field name in the rules when they are defined.</p>

<p></p>

<h2 id="Use_Case_#1"><span class="mw-headline" id="Use_Case_.231">Use Case #1</span></h2>

<p>When creating a new request, automatically set the service desk group to the level 1 support group of the actual service specified.</p>

<h4 id="1._Create_a_‘Set_field’_rule_in_the_Request_Workflow"><span class="mw-headline" id="1._Create_a_.E2.80.98Set_field.E2.80.99_rule_in_the_Request_Workflow">1. Create a ‘Set field’ rule in the Request Workflow</span></h4>

<p>The ‘Set field’ rule can be used to set a field to a specific value or to the result of an expression. For the automatic assignment, the desired group may be set to a specific value or by an expression that looks up a group based on some other value in the current record (such as the service).</p>

<p>For this use case, the following set field rule is used during the ‘Classify’ phase of a request to set the group:</p>

<div class="mw-highlight mw-content-ltr" dir="ltr">
<pre>If&nbsp;${entity.ServiceDeskGroup == null}

Set&nbsp;Service desk group&nbsp;to ${entity.RegisteredForActualService.SupportLevel1Group}</pre>
</div>

<p>The condition of this rule first checks to see if the service desk is not already filled in (we don’t want to overwrite a value that the agent has entered). Next, it specifies that we are going to fill in the ‘Service desk group’ field. Finally, the DSL expression finds the level 1 support group (a field in the service record) of the service that is entered into the current request.</p>

<h2 id="Use_Case_#2"><span class="mw-headline" id="Use_Case_.232">Use Case #2</span></h2>

<p>When creating a new request, automatically set the service desk group based on a pre-defined routing definition. The routing definition allows for a group to be selected based on a combination of a service, location, and/or organization.</p>

</ol>

<h4 class="mw-headline" id="1._Create_the_desired_Routing_Definition">1. Create the desired Routing Definition</h4>

<p>Alternatively, the ‘Set field based on routing definition’ rule allows for a group to be selected based on a combination of a service, location, and/or organization. These values are taken from the current record (request, incident, etc.) and evaluated against a more complex set of rules to determine the proper assignment. The actual routing definition is created through a graphical interface, and must exist before the rule is created. More information on routing definitions may be found in the <a href="./itom/SMAX:2019.05/RoutingDefOvw" title="SMAX:2019.05/RoutingDefOvw">on-line help</a>.</p>

<p>In this example we have a routing definition that selects a group based on a service and a location. ￼<br>

<p>The ‘Set field based on routing definition’ rule is used to set a field to a specific value based on a combination of service, location, and/or organization data. The rule will require the administrator to specify where each value should come from.</p>

<p>For this use case, the following“Set field based on routing definition” rule is used during the ‘Classify’ phase of a request to set the group:</p>

<div class="mw-highlight mw-content-ltr" dir="ltr">
<pre>If&nbsp;${entity.ServiceDeskGroup == null} 
Set Service desk group&nbsp;based on routing definition&nbsp;
Service Based&nbsp;with&nbsp;
Actual Services: entity.RegistredForActualService.Id 
Locations: entity.RequestedByPerson.CurrentLocation.Id</pre>
</div>

<p>In this use case we are using the location of the requested by person.</p>

<h2 id="Use_Case_#3"><span class="mw-headline" id="Use_Case_.233">Use Case #3</span></h2>

<p>When an end user creates a request through the Service Management Automation X Service Portal, set the service desk group based on the following logic:</p>

<ul>
	<li>For a specific service offering/incident model/change model, set the group based on one of:
	<ul>
		<li>A specific routing definition - or -</li>
		<li>The support group field in the associated service definition - or -</li>
		<li>A specific group</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Or if the actual service is defined then set the group based on:
	<ul>
		<li>A specific routing definition - or -</li>
		<li>The support group field in the service record - or -</li>
		<li>A specific group</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Or if the service is not defined but a location is part of a specific geography then set the group based on:
	<ul>
		<li>A different location based routing definition</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Or set the group to a specific default group</li>
</ul>

<h3 class="mw-headline" id="Configuration_Steps_-_Detail_3">Configuration Steps - Detail</h3>

<h4 class="mw-headline" id="1._Create_business_rules_for_each_specific_Offering">1. Create business rules for each specific Offering</h4>

<p>To perform the logic above rules need to be added not only to the record type in question but also to each service offering/incident model/change model record that has specific rules. These rules are entered directly into the applicable record in either the ‘Default Values’ tab (if setting to a specific value) or the ‘Rules’ tab (if using a routing definition). Additionally, the configuration gives the option to run the specific rules either before or after the general record business rules. In order for our logic to succeed, it is important to run the offering/model rules before the general ones.</p>

<p><a class="image" onclick="javascript:loadingImage(this);"><img alt="suc ModelAssignRules 1b.png" data-file-height="688" data-file-width="1094" height="688" src="/mediawiki/images/0/02/suc_ModelAssignRules_1b.png" width="1094"></a></p>

<h4 class="mw-headline" id="2._Create_the_general_business_rules_for_the_Request_record">2. Create the general business rules for the Request record</h4>

<p>The remaining logic will be located in the general record rules. In this case the Incident record rules. For each rule the current value of the group field in question (service desk group in our case) is checked to see if it is still blank before attempting to supply a value. ￼</p>

<p>With these rules our initial logic is now met. The correct group will be set only if the current field has not already been filled in. Using this methodology, any number of automatic assignment rules may be defined in order to follow the assignment logic for any implementation.</p>

<p><a class="image" onclick="javascript:loadingImage(this);"><img alt="IncidentAssignRules.png" data-file-height="837" data-file-width="485" height="837" src="/mediawiki/images/7/76/IncidentAssignRules.png" width="485"></a></p>

<h2 id="Use_Case_#4"><span class="mw-headline" id="Use_Case_.234">Use Case #4</span></h2>

<p>In some situations it may be necessary to pass a particular record (request/incident/change/etc.) between multiple groups. Instead of relying on the agent to pick the correct entry from the entire list of groups, we want to suggest one or more groups to choose from. There are two rule types that are useful for this purpose, both of which should be used in the ‘Rendering forms’ section of the rules:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Define suggested values based on filter</li>
	<li>Define suggested values based on routing definition</li>
</ul>

<p>An important feature to note is that multiple rules can be configured for the same field, resulting in multiple suggestions being shown to the Agent when entering that field. Since each suggestion may be labeled differently, this can be a valuable tool to assist the Agent in selecting the right group.</p>

<p>Similar to the automatic assignment, these rules may be placed either in the general record (request/incident/etc.) or in the associated offering/model record. All suggestions (from both the general and associated rules) are shown to the agent when selecting the proper group.</p>

<h3 class="mw-headline" id="Configuration_Steps_-_Summary_4">Configuration Steps - Summary</h3>

<ol>
	<li>Define suggested values based on filter</li>
	<li>Define suggested values based on routing definition</li>
</ol>

<h3 class="mw-headline" id="Configuration_Steps_-_Detail_4">Configuration Steps - Detail</h3>

<h4 class="mw-headline" id="1._Define_suggested_values_based_on_filter">1. Define suggested values based on filter</h4>

<p>Using this rule type we can limit the possible groups to either a hard-coded list or a list that matches a DSL expression. For this example, we will create a total of three rules that will display:</p>

<ul>
	<li>The level 1 support group of the associated Service (if one is specified)</li>
	<li>A hard-coded list of service desks if there is no level 1 support group (or no service specified)</li>
	<li>The level 2 and level 3 support groups of the associated service (if one is specified)</li>
	<li>A list of all groups</li>
</ul>

<p>The actual rules needed are:</p>

<p><a class="image" onclick="javascript:loadingImage(this);"><img alt="UseCases4 Rules.png" data-file-height="350" data-file-width="1063" height="350" src="/mediawiki/images/0/03/UseCases4_Rules.png" width="1063"></a></p>

<p>When the agent selects the service desk group field with a service that has a level 1 support group, they will see the following:</p>

<p><a class="image" onclick="javascript:loadingImage(this);"><img alt="assign search-1.png" data-file-height="680" data-file-width="839" height="680" src="/mediawiki/images/2/22/assign_search-1.png" width="839"></a></p>

<p>Whereas if there is no level 1 support group defined, they will see:</p>

<p><a class="image" onclick="javascript:loadingImage(this);"><img alt="assign search-2.png" data-file-height="678" data-file-width="821" height="678" src="/mediawiki/images/8/8d/assign_search-2.png" width="821"></a></p>

<h4 class="mw-headline" id="2._Define_suggested_values_based_on_routing_definition">2. Define suggested values based on routing definition</h4>

<p>This rule has the same result of displaying the suggested groups to the agent, but instead of a simple filter a routing definition is used. Identical to the ‘set field using routing definition rule’, a combination of service, location, and organization may be used to dynamically select the suggested groups. The groups that are displayed is the combination of the ‘Default group’ that is used in the set field rule, as well as any ‘Suggested groups’ that have been defined. Note that each ‘node’ of the routing definition will display the number of groups, if any, that will be used as suggestions. To see the actual groups you must edit the node.</p>

<p><a class="image" onclick="javascript:loadingImage(this);"><img alt="routing-suggestions.png" data-file-height="198" data-file-width="296" height="198" src="/mediawiki/images/4/4a/routing-suggestions.png" width="296"></a></p>

<p>The actual rule would look like:</p>

<p><a class="image" onclick="javascript:loadingImage(this);"><img alt="routingSuggestion2.png" data-file-height="103" data-file-width="709" height="103" src="/mediawiki/images/c/c4/routingSuggestion2.png" width="709"></a></p>

<p>This rule would then display the suggested groups in a section titled ‘Suggested by location’. This rule could be included with the previous rules in order to give the agent multiple suggestion options. However, it is recommended to keep the number of different suggestion rules to the minimum needed, otherwise the agent could actually become more confused about which to use.</p>
