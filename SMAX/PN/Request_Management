<p><br>
Request management handles the end to end process of receiving a request from an end user and fulfilling it. A properly prepared request management process reduces the load on agents by allowing end users to fulfill their own requests without agent involvement either by automating common request offerings (such as password resets) or providing knowledge that will allow the end user to answer a question by themselves.
</p><p>In order to direct the implementation towards this end, the service desk managers must take the time to investigate the requests that do not fit an existing offering or cannot be resolved using the existing knowledge base. With this information, new pre-defined offerings (with specified task plans) may be created and new knowledge articles may be added to the system to improve the experience for the next request of the same type.
</p><p>The ability to assist end users with their requests may also be measured in targeted surveys. These surveys can gather feedback on areas ranging from the agents’ performance to the overall satisfaction with a particular service.

<p>Once we have our service catalog set up we need to give our agents a way to fulfill the incoming requests and respond to the end users. This is the primary job function of our service desk, and they will handle those requests through the request management module.
</p><p>The easiest way to think about the process is that any interaction with the end user will go through a request. We have other methods for our internal agents to start processes, but by directing all end user communication through requests we can keep our backend functions separate from (but connected to) our customer-facing functions. Whether the service desk is taking a phone call, responding to an email, or the end user makes a request directly through the Service Management Automation Service Portal, the result in our system will be a request.
</p><p>In Service Management Automation X the Request process is ready to go out of the box, but there are a few places where we might want to configure it a little before we begin. The first thing we need to look at is the record categories we want to use. Notice that these record categories are completely separate from the service categories we created for the service catalog.
</p><p><br>
</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Setting_up_our_Record_Categories">Setting up our Record Categories</span><span class="mw-editsection"><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">[</span><a href="/mediawiki/index.php?title=SMAX:2018.05/PractitionersNotes/GettingStarted/RequestManagement&amp;veaction=edit&amp;section=2" class="mw-editsection-visualeditor" title="Edit section: Setting up our Record Categories">edit</a><span class="mw-editsection-divider"> | </span><a href="/mediawiki/index.php?title=SMAX:2018.05/PractitionersNotes/GettingStarted/RequestManagement&amp;action=edit&amp;section=2" title="Edit section: Setting up our Record Categories">edit source</a><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">]</span></span></h2>
<p>The first thing we want our system to do is to help the service desk agents classify the request while providing initial support. Initial support in our case means the analysis, evaluation, and routing of the request by our first line agents. By classifying the request into a pre-defined category we can help the initial agent ask the proper questions and direct the request to the proper group. One thing to keep in mind though is the fact we can't be 100% sure we have the right category for a request until we're finished with it. So it's important to train our agents to review the categorization at the end of the request process and correct it when necessary.
</p><p>Categorizing the requests will also assist us in investigating the requests over time and determining specific trouble areas where we may need to invest in improving our service offerings or even change the existing services themselves.
</p><p>In Service Management Automation X the record categories are defined using a three-level hierarchy, so we can have two levels of sub-categorization under the main categories. We don't have to use all three levels for every category though. Once we add a record category, we won’t be able to delete it (that would 'break' the data integrity of existing records that used it), but we can make them inactive so agents cannot add them to new records. Either way, we should do our homework and try our best to build an accurate categorization structure for our services. The effort here will be well worth the time spent.
</p><p>One thing we might want to consider here is whether we want to add a catch-all record category. This might be useful as we train our agents or bring someone new onboard, as it might not be clear to them which category to use. If we create an 'Unknown' category, it will give them a quick way of getting past the classification process. However, if we do this we need to think about adding a business rule (Service Management Automation X’s method of letting us change the out of box workflow of a process) that won’t allow a request to close while still in the “Unknown” category. Having the “Unknown” category exist after a request closes would make it much harder for the request managers to mine the data for trends and problem areas.

<p>The next thing we want to do is give our agents some quick and easy ways to see what is going on in the system and get to the tickets they need to work on. The first thing they will see when they log in is the system dashboard, but then each user can customize the dashboard to fit their personal preference and work habits. I will need to review the list of out of the box reports and add any I think our agents might want or need.
</p><p>The second thing we need to do is to make sure there are adequate views defined for our agents. The agents will use these views to manage their workload and determine which Requests they should work on. There are already pre-defined views such as 'My Requests’, which should be enough for the majority of our agents. However, one manager requested that I make a public view of 'All Active Critical Requests'.
</p><p>I can easily create this view by going to the requests list from the 'Service Request' menu. From there I need to edit the current filter to what I want, that click the 'Edit views' button at the top of the screen. Using the 'Save view as' option I can name the new view the way I want and mark it as public so everyone can view it.

<p>Micro Focus created the Live Support module specifically for the agents that will create requests coming in through the company’s phone system. Live Support can connect directly to our Computer Telephony Integration (CTI) system so the agent can see the caller’s name, related information, and recent requests without having to take any action. If we are not using CTI, the agent simply begins to type the caller’s name and the system will provide a list of possible matches in the system. Live Support can also help the agent to determine the proper resolution of the request depending on the description they have entered. Live Support will suggest:
</p>
<ul><li>Knowledge articles based on the request description</li>
<li>Recent incidents on the service specified in the request</li>
<li>Any known issues with the equipment (configuration items) that the caller has</li>
<li>Offerings that might relate to the request description</li>
<li>Knowledge articles that the agent has marked as their favorites</li></ul>
<p>This functionality brings curated system knowledge from several areas and puts it in front of the agent automatically. This can save the agent time and produce a better experience for the caller. The agent can resolve the request directly from Live Support, or create a new request for processing by another agent or team.

<p>At this point, we have enough functionality for our end users to make requests through our Service Management Automation Service Portal, and our agents to enter Requests manually through Live Support. However, what we want is a system that helps both groups find the best way to resolve their requests. While the system will recommend offerings for repeatable types of requests, we also want it to suggest possible solutions for issues or questions. Service Management Automation X includes a powerful search engine that will do exactly that, but we need to make the system “smarter” regarding the services we provide by adding knowledge articles to the system.
</p><p>While we'll look into the method of authoring new knowledge articles later in this guide, we can take advantage of the knowledge we already have created using Service Management Automation X's Knowledge Packaging Tool. With this tool, we will take all of our current knowledge, convert it to HTML if necessary, and use the tool to package it into a format the Service Management Automation X can understand.
</p><p>Once we import these packaged articles into our system, our end users and agents will have access to the knowledge that might assist them in processing their requests. We’ll take a look at how the knowledge ties into the other processes later.
</p><p>Here is the <a target="1" rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://docs.microfocus.com/ITSMA/2018.05/NG/SM_X/Content/Search.htm#search-knowledge%20packaging%20tool">documentation for the Knowledge Packaging Tool</a> if you want to see the specifics of how we are going to be importing our knowledge articles.

<p>Once we have our service request system up and running, we need to ensure that it is fulfilling the users’ needs and continue to improve it. One of the best ways we can judge the opinions of the people using the system is simply to ask them, which is what we can use surveys to do.
</p><p>With surveys, we can customize a set of questions to determine customer satisfaction with areas such as:
</p>
<ul><li>How easy was it to navigate our service request catalog to find what they were looking for?</li>
<li>Was their request fulfilled in an acceptable amount of time?</li>
<li>If calling the Service desk directly, how well did our agent help them to fulfill the request?</li>
<li>Was the service desk agent’s accent believable? (kidding!)</li></ul>
<p>The survey module not only gives us a way to ask these questions but also gives us an excellent way to investigate the results of both the structured responses (those with a limited set of responses to choose from) and unstructured ones as well (such as free-form text). Service Management Automation X includes Big Data analysis features that can group similar text and provide simple but powerful graphical method of unstructured analysis. Of course, now that I’ve gotten you interested in this functionality, I’ll tell you we’ll be looking at it in detail later…

</p><p>Using standard business rules, we can send out surveys automatically when certain things happen — like when the request is closed or when the end user rejects a solution.
</p><p>We’ll look into the details soon, but if you can’t wait you can <a target="1" rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://docs.microfocus.com/ITSMA/2018.05/NG/SM_X/Content/Search.htm#search-survey">check out Surveys</a> in the online help.
