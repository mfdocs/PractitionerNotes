<html>Introduction
<p><br>
Some customers new to SMAX (or ITIL v3 in general) are confused about what IT services are and what services they themselves support. ITIL defines it as "a service provided to one or more customers by an IT service provider." In more simple terms, if an end user contacts the Service Desk with a request, and the agent's answer is anything but "we don't support that", that request is somehow related to a supported IT Service.</p>

<h2>What are Services?</h2>

<p><br>
Services that IT provides to end users are called Business Services. Examples could include collaboration services, email services, or mobile device support. Services that are used internally by IT are called Infrastructure Services. Some examples of these might include data storage or networking services. Some services can even be made up of other services.<br>
<br>
More information on Services and how they are defined can be found here: <a href="https://docs.microfocus.com/itom/SMAX:latest/PN/SACMOverview">SACM Overview</a><br>
<br>
Finding and defining the IT Services can be one of the most time-consuming parts of creating any SMAX implementation, but it can also create the most value. Knowing the entirety of what IT does (and doesn't) support is an invaluable piece of information. Once the high level services are known, the creation of the Service Catalog can begin in earnest.<br>

<h2>Designing the Service Catalog&nbsp;</h2>

<p><br>
The Service Catalog is separated into three sections:</p>

<p></p>

<ul>
	<li>Service Categories</li>
	<li>Service Definitions</li>
	<li>Offerings</li>
</ul>

<p><br>
Precise definitions and examples of each of these levels may be found here: <a href="https://docs.microfocus.com/itom/SMAX:latest/PN/ServiceCatalog">The Service Catalog</a><br>
&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Design for the End User</h3>

<p>When designing the Service Catalog, the most important design consideration is to create the catalog for the end user, not the agents. While the purpose of the Service Catalog is to reduce the load on the agents, this can only be accomplished if the end user is able to easily find what they are looking for. &nbsp;<br>
<br>
For example, when browsing the Service Categories, the end user is much more likely to understand what is contained in a category named "Phone and Mobile" than one labelled "Telecom".&nbsp;</p>

<h3><br>
Design for Search</h3>

<p>Along the same lines, when creating Offerings, the descriptions must contain the right information so the end user can find them when searching. The SMAX Service Portal works best when the users simply search for what they are looking for help with. However, this only works if the Offerings contain all of the information the user might search for. When designing the Offerings, include as much information about them in the descriptions as possible.</p>
