<html><h1>Introduction</h1>

<p>New users of SMAX often start their implementation with the expectation that it is simply&nbsp;a new version of Service Manager. While SMAX incorporated lessons learned from decades of ITSM experience, it was created with a completely new way of looking at the processes, user interactions, and overall experiences.</p>

<p>SMAX focuses on the organizations ability to provide services to end users, and is proactive in solving end user issues versus managing IT "tickets". For new users (and administrators), some adjustment to the old mindset and approach will be necessary. This doesn't mean that the old mindset or approach is "wrong", but simply that it does not apply to SMAX.</p>

<p>This document will investigate some of the concepts that are markedly different between SMAX and Service Manager. While not every difference can be reviewed in detail, we will concentrate on areas pointed out by real customers of both products.</p>

<h2>How Do I Do "X" in SMAX?</h2>

<h3>Create Multiple Workflows for Incidents</h3>

<p>Processes within SMAX use a pre-defined workflow or set of workflows to create and track records using that specific process. You can configure these workflows to fit specific requirements not included in the out-of-box definitions, but you can not add new workflows within the processes.</p>

<p>The use of only the existing workflows enforces commonality to the records within a process. This results in easier integrations, consistency in reporting, the ability to use a common set of performance indicators, and allows the use of common views.</p>

<p>You can modify existing workflows by adding new phases within the defined set of steps (also called meta-phases). Those phases will be used by every record within the associated process.</p>

<p>In Service Manager, administrators often add categories to display unique fields, add business logic, add approvals, or add tasks. In SMAX, this same functionality can be added by using models.</p>

<p>If you need unique flow and/or functionality within a specific process, SMAX provides models (called Offerings inside the Service Request process). These models allow you to extend the process in a number of ways, including:</p>

<ul>
	<li>
	<p>adding specific fields, called “User options” to the process</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>adding rules that apply to the process using the model</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>adding approvals (to applicable processes)</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>setting default values</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>adding tasks (in series or parallel) to one or more phases of the process</p>
	</li>
</ul>
