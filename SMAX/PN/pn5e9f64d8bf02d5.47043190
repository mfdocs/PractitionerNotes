<html><h1>Introduction</h1>

<p>New users of SMAX often start their implementation with the expectation that it is simply&nbsp;a new version of Service Manager. While SMAX incorporated lessons learned from decades of ITSM experience, it was created with a completely new way of looking at the processes, user interactions, and overall experiences.</p>

<p>SMAX focuses on the organizations ability to provide services to end users, and is proactive in solving end user issues versus managing IT "tickets". For new users (and administrators), some adjustment to the old mindset and approach will be necessary. This doesn't mean that the old mindset or approach is "wrong", but simply that it does not apply to SMAX.</p>

<p>This document will investigate some of the concepts that are markedly different between SMAX and Service Manager. While not every difference can be reviewed in detail, we will concentrate on areas pointed out by real customers of both products.</p>

<p></p>

<h2>Concept Changes</h2>

<p></p>

<h3>Service Based Support</h3>

<p>One of the primary differences between SMAX and other solutions is that it was designed around services. The most important step of a successful SMAX implementation is defining the business and infrastructure services that make up your company's IT portfolio.<br>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Service Definitions</h4>

<p>The ITIL process documentation defines an IT Service as "a service provided to one or more customers by an IT service provider." In the real world, it means that any subject of a call, email, or portal request from an end user that IT supports is part of a IT Service. By clearly defining these services, the IT department can accurately and succinctly define the supported processes around these services. This will result in a much higher (and faster) return on the investment made in implementing SMAX.<br>
<br>
By creating the list of supported IT Services, the amount of calls or emails pertaining to issues that the Service Desk has no control over is lowered. This still leaves those requests that might be related to a IT Service that are simply not under the control of IT. In order to inform the end users about what is available through the Service Desk, as well as to better control and categorize incoming requests, SMAX allows the definition of specific Offerings under an IT Service. These Offerings make up what is known as the Service Catalog -- literally a listing of everything the IT Service Desk supports.<br>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Service Catalog</h4>

<p>Micro Focus designed the Service Catalog around the service definitions (as the name would suggest). Think about the catalog as the menu that end users use to "consume" the defined services. And if the users are ordering from a menu, the IT agents are in the kitchen working to fulfill these requests.<br>
<br>
Creating a complete service catalog can be one of the more time-consuming parts of a SMAX implementation. And as the IT department changes and takes on more responsibilities, the number of service definitions and associated offerings will continue to grow. The Service Catalog should be thought of as a living thing, and change should be expected (and even embraced).</p>

<h4></h4>

<h4>Categorization and the Search Focused End Portal</h4>

<p>One of the most visible differences in the End User Portal in Service Manager and SMAX is in the categorization hierarchy of the Service Catalog. While the Service Manager catalog allows multiple layers of categorization, SMAX has only three levels of navigation. These levels are:<br>
<br>
Category -&gt; Service Definition -&gt; Offering<br>
<br>
The flattened structure of the SMAX Service Catalog makes it easier for both the administrators and the end users to determine where a specific offering should reside. However, navigating the categories and service definitions manually is not the most efficient way for an end user to find what they are looking for.<br>
<br>
The End User Portal was designed with search as the primary method for users to find the correct Offering. A single search will return both Offerings and Knowledge Articles that most reflect what the user is looking for.<br>
<br>

<h2>How Do I Do "X" in SMAX?</h2>

<p></p>

<h3>Create Multiple Workflows for Incidents</h3>

<p>Processes within SMAX use a pre-defined workflow or set of workflows to create and track records using that specific process. You can configure these workflows to fit specific requirements not included in the out-of-box definitions, but you can not add new workflows within the processes.</p>

<p>The use of only the existing workflows enforces commonality to the records within a process. This results in easier integrations, consistency in reporting, the ability to use a common set of performance indicators, and allows the use of common views.</p>

<p>You can modify existing workflows by adding new phases within the defined set of steps (also called meta-phases). Those phases will be used by every record within the associated process.</p>

<p>In Service Manager, administrators often add categories to display unique fields, add business logic, add approvals, or add tasks. In SMAX, this same functionality can be added by using models.</p>

<p>If you need unique flow and/or functionality within a specific process, SMAX provides models (called Offerings inside the Service Request process). These models allow you to extend the process in a number of ways, including:</p>

<ul>
	<li>
	<p>adding specific fields, called “User options” to the process</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>adding rules that apply to the process using the model</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>adding approvals (to applicable processes)</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>setting default values</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>adding tasks (in series or parallel) to one or more phases of the process</p>
	</li>
</ul>

<p>Further information around workflows and models may be found in the following document:&nbsp;<a href="https://docs.microfocus.com/itom/SMAX:2020.02/PN/pn5eaa11a4670d23.08425592">Enhancing Workflow with Models</a></p>

<h3>Create Unique Forms for Different Categories of Incidents</h3>

<p></p>

<h3>Access the Underlying Database for Reporting</h3>

<p></p>

<h3>"Kill" a User Session</h3>

<p>When a Service Manager user leaves a session running while they are away or their session hangs, they are still using a license and may block other users from updating a record if they have it locked (due to SM's pessimistic locking strategy). Even if the user logs in another session, the old session is still "active" and taking up resources. In these cases, the SM administrator may "kill" the users's session, freeing up resources, licences, and any record locks.</p>

<p>SMAX users can have multiple concurrent sessions (even from multiple devices) and still only consume a single license. Session timeouts are handled by the SMAX engine, and any inactive sessions are closed automatically. Additionaly, SMAX uses optimistic locking, so viewing or updating a record does not lock it for other users.</p>

<p>For these reasons, there is no need for the administrator to kill a SMAX user session.&nbsp;</p>
