<html><h1>Introduction</h1>

<p>New users of SMAX often start their implementation with the expectation that it is simple a new version of Service Manager. While SMAX incorporated lessons learned from decades of ITSM experience, it was created with a completely new way of looking at the processes, user interactions, and overall experiences.</p>

<p>SMAX focuses on the organizations ability to provide services to end users, and is proactive in solving end user issues versus managing IT "tickets".&nbsp;</p>
