<html><h1>Introduction</h1>

<p>New users of SMAX often start their implementation with the expectation that it is simple a new version of Service Manager. While SMAX incorporated lessons learned from decades of ITSM experience, it was created with a completely new way of looking at the processes, user interactions, and overall experiences.</p>

<p>SMAX focuses on the organizations ability to provide services to end users, and is proactive in solving end user issues versus managing IT "tickets". For new users (and administrators), some adjustment to the old mindset and approach will be necessary. This doesn't mean that the old mindset or approach is "wrong", but simply that it does not apply to SMAX.</p>

<p>This document will investigate some of the concepts that are markedly different between SMAX and Service Manager. While not every difference can be reviewed in detail, we will concentrate on areas pointed out by real customers of both products.</p>
