<div class="mw-parser-output"><p>The administrator wants to set the service desk group on all requests created through the Service Management Automation Service Portal to a group named ‘Initial Ticket Reviewers’. When the dev2prod process runs the rule needs to use the group with the same name on the production tenant. The administrator needs to create a set field rule using the group_id_by_upn() function. Click on the ‘fx’ button to use the function. In order to not update the field every time or overwrite a value that may be set later in the workflow an ‘if’ condition should be used. It’s also possible to put the rule in a location that will only run once, for example entering the ‘Log’ phase. In the example an If condition is added to make sure that the field is not already set, and if it’s not set and entering the ‘Log’ phase then the service desk group is set.
