<h2 class="mw-headline" id="Introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>Entitlements restrict offerings, knowledge articles, service definitions, categories, and custom themes in the Service Management Automation X Service Portal to limited audiences in specified locations or belonging to specified user groups or roles. Adding entitlement rules will result in Service Management Automation X Service Portal users being able to view items that correspond to their location or group membership.
</p>
<h2 class="mw-headline" id="Use_Case">Use Case</h2>
<p>A company named ABC Publishing has offices in three different cities in the United States. The three offices perform different functions:
</p>
<ul><li>San Diego takes care of all the printing activities</li>
<li>New York takes care of all sales activities</li>
<li>Detroit is responsible for marketing</li></ul>
<p><br>
The three offices use different applications and different types of infrastructure, so the offerings that IT provides are different for each office. However, there are common offerings that need to be available to all employees. 
</p><p>All of the offerings fall into three categories. The three categories are ‘Phone and Mobile’, ‘Applications’, and ‘Network Connectivity’. The company wants to use entitlements to limit the offerings end users see based on their locations. The Service Management Automation X administrator needs to configure entitlements for the following offerings:

<h3 class="mw-headline" id="Configuration_Steps_-_Detail">Configuration Steps - Detail</h3>
<h4 class="mw-headline" id="1._Configure_the_locations_for_users">1. Configure the locations for users</h4>
<p>Each user must have their location specified in their Person record. 
To add a location to a person, navigate to <b>Administration &gt; Master Data &gt; People</b>. Select the desired user and then expand the ‘Contact Information’ section. In the location field select one of the 3 locations described in the use case (San Diego, New York or Detroit). Repeat for all the users.
</p>
<h4 class="mw-headline" id="2._Create_entitlement_rules_for_each_office_location">2. Create entitlement rules for each office location</h4>
<p>To create an entitlement rule, navigate to the <b>Administration &gt; Master Data &gt; People-&gt; Entitlement Rules</b>. Click new and enter the name and description of the rule. In this use case 3 entitlement rules will be created with the names ‘San Diego’, ‘New York’ and ‘Detroit’. 
For the entitlement rule named San Diego, in the ‘Rule Definition’ section select the location field and find the San Diego location and select it. For the other 2 cities repeat but select the correct city. Entitlement rules can be added based on location or role, in this case we are using location.
</p>
<h4 class="mw-headline" id="3._Create_entitlement_rules_for_the_parent_location">3. Create entitlement rules for the parent location</h4>
<p>An entitlement rule can be created and used in the described use case using the parent location of the 3 cities. In this case North America/United states. Navigate to the <b>Administration &gt; Master Data &gt; People-&gt; Entitlement Rules</b> and create a new entitlement rule named United States and in the location field select North America\United States. The United States entitlement rule will give permissions to any location that is assigned to a user whose location parent is North America\United States. In our example this means the 3 cities of San Diego, New York and Detroit.
</p>
<h4 class="mw-headline" id="4._Add_an_audience_to_the_category">4. Add an audience to the category</h4>
<p>In many cases customer don’t want a category to appear for all end users. To restrict a category so that end users won’t see it we can use the entitlement rules we have created. Navigate to <b>Service Catalog &gt; Categories</b>. Select the category that needs to be restricted, in this example select the ‘Phone and Mobile’ category. Expand the audience section and then select the United States entitlement rule. Once the entitlement rule is added and saved only those users whose parent location is the United States will be able to view the ‘Phone and Mobile’ category. If no audience was added then all users would be able to view the category, if the San Diego entitlement rule was added then only those users whose location was San Diego would be able to view the category. 
</p>
<h4 class="mw-headline" id="5._Add_an_audience_to_the_offerings">5. Add an audience to the offerings</h4>
<p>To restrict offerings that appear in each category the location based entitlement rules need to be added to the appropriate offerings. Navigate to <b>Service Catalog &gt; Offerings</b>. In the use case to assign the correct entitlements to the ‘Create network login’ offering that is required for all 3 offices, either the United States entitlement rule can be applied or the 3 entitlement rules for San Diego, New York or Detroit could be applied. In the case where not all of the locations required access, apply the appropriate rules for those locations that do need access. Using the ‘Request PC Phone Service’ offering example, select the offering and in the audience list select the New York and Detroit entailment rules.
<br>
</p>
<h2 class="mw-headline" id="Notes">Notes</h2>
<p>Locations are configured in the <b>Administration-&gt; Master Data -&gt; Locations</b> form. The hierarchy for locations is Region -&gt; Country -&gt; City -&gt; Site -&gt; Floor -&gt; Building -&gt; etc. This is visible in the location form when selecting the Type of location when added them.
