<div class="mw-parser-output"><p>While setting up the completion codes that the IT agents use when closing requests the administrator decided that the value ‘Solved by Social’ was not required in the list of available completion codes. In order to filter this value out of a list, a new ‘<b>Define suggested values by a list to list mapping</b>’ rule needs to be added.
</p><p>Enter the name of the list for both the source and destination lists. Map the names of the values to themselves, if a value is not needed do not add a mapping and it will not appear after the rule is applied. If there is a security reason that the value is being removed, a validation rule needs to be added to make sure that it can’t be populated using a different method than the UI.
