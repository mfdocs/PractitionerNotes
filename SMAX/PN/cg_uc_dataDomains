<h2 class="mw-headline" id="Introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>Data domain segmentation in&nbsp;Service Management Automation X&nbsp;provides the ability to restrict the visibility of specific records and actions (such as incidents, changes, or specific approvals) to specific people, roles, or groups.&nbsp;
Data&nbsp;domain&nbsp;segmentation&nbsp;is composed of two parts: <br><br>
<b>1.  Assignment of permissions to view particular&nbsp;data&nbsp;domains to a person, role, or group.</b> <br>
The automatic assignment of permissions to view a specific&nbsp;data&nbsp;domain&nbsp;is best done by selecting a primary&nbsp;data&nbsp;domain&nbsp;for a group or user. For more information, see&nbsp;<a href="./itom/SMAX:2019.05/AssignDomainPrimary" title="SMAX:2019.05/AssignDomainPrimary">How to assign a Primary&nbsp;data&nbsp;domain&nbsp;to a group or user</a>.<br>
</p><p><b>2.  Assignment of&nbsp;data&nbsp;domains to records.</b> <br>
The automatic assignment of&nbsp;data&nbsp;domains to records as a result of out-of-the-box business rules running in&nbsp;Service Management Automation X&nbsp;is the recommended best practice.&nbsp;Data&nbsp;domains can also be assigned to records manually in specific instances, but this is not recommended as maintenance and automation become much more complicated.<br>
</p>
<h2 id="Use_Case_#1"><span class="mw-headline" id="Use_Case_.231">Use Case #1</span></h2>
<p>Our Service Management Automation X system contains information pertaining to all aspects of our company’s day-to-day operations. Some information in the system is considered confidential and should only be available to users that are part of certain groups. Specifically there are issues relevant to the IT department and the HR department that should only be visible to users in those respective departments. Additionally, some issues may be relevant to both departments. When an issue (request/incident/problem/change/etc.) is specified as an IT or HR issue, users that are not part of those groups should not be able to see the record.

<h3 class="mw-headline" id="Configuration_Steps_-_Detail">Configuration Steps - Detail</h3>
<h4 class="mw-headline" id="1._Create_Data_Domains_list_and_make_them_available_for_selection">1. Create Data Domains list and make them available for selection</h4>
<p>By default on all new Service Management Automation X tenants, there is a single data domain named ‘Public.’ The public domain is the global domain that all users are members. Additional data domains are added through the list management menu. 
</p><p>To add a new domain navigate to <b>Administration -&gt; List Management -&gt; Data Domains</b>. Select the list and then add the new data domain values to the list. Any values added to the list will be available for selection when configuration access. The data domain list is like any other list and values can be translated into any required languages. It is also important to plan any additions to the list carefully. Once a value is added to the list it may not be removed, and rendering rules must be added on every referencing form to hide specific values that are no longer desired.
</p><p>For our use case we will add two domains to the data domains list: ‘HR’ and ‘IT’. These domains will be used as primary domains where applicable.
</p>
<h4 class="mw-headline" id="2._Configure_group_and_person_forms_with_the_primary_domain_field">2. Configure group and person forms with the primary domain field</h4>
<p>In order to be able to assign a primary domain to a group or person, the field needs to be added to the default forms for the person and group record types. The data domains field is available on the roles form by default. 
</p><p>To add the primary domain field to the group form, navigate to <b>Administration -&gt; Configuration -&gt; Records</b> and select the ‘Group’ entity. Under the forms select the ‘Full PersonGroup’ form. Click ‘Add field’ and add the ‘Primary Domain’ field and save. 
To add the field to the person form, navigate to Administration -&gt; Configuration -&gt; Records and select the ‘Person’ entity. Under the forms select the ‘Full Person form’. Click ‘Add field’ and add the ‘Primary Domain’ field and save.
</p><p>It is also possible to directly add a data domain to an entity itself (request, change, incident etc). If this is the desired behavior, navigate to each of these entity types and add the ‘Data Domains’ field to the desired forms. 
</p>
<h4 id="3._Add_a_primary_domain_to_Groups,_Users_or_Roles"><span class="mw-headline" id="3._Add_a_primary_domain_to_Groups.2C_Users_or_Roles">3. Add a primary domain to Groups, Users or Roles</span></h4>
<p>Each user or group only has a single primary domain, but data domains are cumulative for the user. Therefore they can belong to multiple data domains based on their group and role membership. 
To add the primary domain to a person, navigate to <b>Administration &gt; Master Data &gt; People</b>. Select the desired person and assign a data domain to the person in the ‘Primary Domain’ field. The ‘Primary Domain’ field will allow any value that was specified as a Data domain in the first configuration step.
</p><p>To add the primary domain to a group, navigate to <b>Administration &gt; Master Data &gt; People &gt; Groups</b>. Select the group and assign the Domain using the ‘Primary Domain’ field.
</p><p>Users belonging to a group will inherit the primary domain assigned to the group. If users belong to multiple groups they will inherit from all of their groups. To add the primary domain to a group, navigate to the <b>Administration &gt; Master Data &gt; People &gt; Groups</b>.
</p><p>Data domains can be added to roles by using the ‘Data Domain’ field. You may specify multiple domains for each role. To assign domains, navigate to <b>Administration &gt; Master Data &gt; People -&gt; Roles</b>. Select the desired role and assign the domains required in the ‘Data Domains’ field.
</p><p>Domains are most often added to groups when referencing specific tickets (incidents/requests/changes/etc.). Adding domains to roles works well to control the data available in specific views and/or reports.
</p><p>For this specific use case all IT groups would have primary domain of ‘IT’ and the HR groups would have a primary domain of ‘HR’. 
</p>
<h4 class="mw-headline" id="4._Add_default_data_domain_to_Offerings">4. Add default data domain to Offerings</h4>
<p>In many cases, the desired behavior is to automatically assign a request to a certain domain based on the selected offering. Data domains can be assigned by adding a group into one of the group fields in the ‘Default values’ tab of the offering. Navigate to <b>Service Catalog -&gt; Offering -&gt; &lt;Select the Offering&gt; -&gt; Default Values -&gt; Add a Group</b> that has a primary domain assigned and configured in a previous step. All requests opened with this offering will automatically be assigned to the configured group which will in turn automatically assign the data domain.
</p><p>When end users create requests and select an offering, the request will automatically be assigned to the service desk group and the data domain applied so only those members of the domain can view them. If no primary domain exists on a group and a request assigned to it then the request remains public and anyone can view the request. 
</p><p>For this specific use case, we review all offerings and assign the default service desk group appropriately — being sure to assign HR offerings to an HR group and IT offerings to an IT group.
</p><p>If an HR request needs interaction by IT the service desk group would be set to an IT group, at which time the data domain for IT will be added to the specific request. In this case, both the IT and HR groups may view the request.
</p>
<h4 class="mw-headline" id="5._Create_rules_to_add_or_remove_data_domains">5. Create rules to add or remove data domains</h4>
<p>In some cases, it is preferable to use business rules to add domains based on information in the current record (such as category or business service). In order to accomplish this, business rules can be added to append or remove domains based on specified conditions. 
Note that using the ‘Set field’ rule type on data domains will do a full REMOVE and then ADD of the new value. Only use the ‘Set field’ if you want to remove any existing domains and only have the value in the set field. To append values or remove a specific value, use the ‘Append or remove values in a multi-value field’ rule type.
</p><p>To add the new owner’s primary data domain to an entity (if they have one defined):
</p>
<pre>If ${current_update.OwnedByPerson.IsChanged &amp;&amp; current_update.OwnedByPerson.NewValue&nbsp;!= null &amp;&amp; current_update.OwnedByPerson.NewValue.PrimaryDataDomain&nbsp;!= null}

Append to multi-value field Data domains the following values ${entity.OwnedByPerson.PrimaryDataDomain}

</pre>
<p>It is also necessary to remove the ‘Public’ group if it had previously been set. Otherwise everyone will still be able to view the record:
</p>
<pre>If ${current_update.OwnedByPerson.IsChanged &amp;&amp; current_update.OwnedByPerson.NewValue&nbsp;!= null &amp;&amp; current_update.OwnedByPerson.NewValue.PrimaryDataDomain&nbsp;!= null}
Remove multi-value field Data domains the following values 
Public
</pre>
<h2 id="Use_Case_#2"><span class="mw-headline" id="Use_Case_.232">Use Case #2</span></h2>
<p>Company ABC uses multiple contracting companies to maintain their network infrastructure. Each of the contracting companies have several onsite members who are assigned the various tasks. Company ABC wants to create a task plan that will allow it to assign tasks to each of these contracting companies while prohibiting them from viewing the details of the change itself or any of the tasks assigned to other contracting companies.

<li>Create a task plan in the change</li></ol>
<p><br>
</p>
<h3 class="mw-headline" id="Configuration_Steps_-_Detail_2">Configuration Steps - Detail</h3>
<h4 class="mw-headline" id="1._Create_Data_Domains_for_each_of_the_contracting_companies">1. Create Data Domains for each of the contracting companies</h4>
<p>Navigate to the Administration-&gt;Lists form and find the ‘Data Domains’ list. Add a new entry for each of the contracting companies. In this use case entries for Contractors A.B and C will be added.
￼
<a onclick="javascript:loadingImage(this);" class="image"><img alt="dataDomain1.png" src="/mediawiki/images/4/4f/dataDomain1.png" width="1456" height="619" data-file-width="1456" data-file-height="619"></a>
</p>
<h4 class="mw-headline" id="2._Create_groups_for_each_of_the_contracting_companies">2. Create groups for each of the contracting companies</h4>
<p>Each of the contracting companies requires a group that contains the onsite contractors. In this use case, groups named Contractor A, B, and C will be added. The users belonging to the contracting companies will be added to the appropriate groups.
</p><p><a onclick="javascript:loadingImage(this);" class="image"><img alt="d1-fixed.png" src="/mediawiki/images/e/e9/d1-fixed.png" width="1009" height="440" data-file-width="1009" data-file-height="440"></a>
</p><p> After creating the groups, the data domain added in the first step needs to be added as the ‘Primary Domain’ for each group. In the example below the “Contractor A” domain is assigned to the Contractor A group.
</p><p><a onclick="javascript:loadingImage(this);" class="image"><img alt="datadomain2.png" src="/mediawiki/images/9/94/datadomain2.png" width="1159" height="405" data-file-width="1159" data-file-height="405"></a>
</p><p>After adding the primary domain to the group, add the users belonging to Contractor A, B or C to the corresponding groups.
</p><p><br>
</p>
<h4 class="mw-headline" id="3._Create_a_task_plan_in_the_change">3. Create a task plan in the change</h4>
<p>Create a new normal change and assign it to the change manager group. In this use case the change manager group has its own data domain named ‘Change Managers’, and only members of this group can view the change. None of the contractors have rights to access entities assigned to the ‘Change Manager’ data domain. In the change, click on the plan and execute tab and then add a new manual task and assign it to the Contractor A group.
</p><p><a onclick="javascript:loadingImage(this);" class="image"><img alt="d3.png" src="/mediawiki/images/2/28/d3.png" width="779" height="696" data-file-width="779" data-file-height="696"></a>
</p><p><br>
When the change manager group user views the change the task plan appears with the 3 tasks (below).
￼
</p><p><a onclick="javascript:loadingImage(this);" class="image"><img alt="dataDomain5.png" src="/mediawiki/images/d/d2/dataDomain5.png" width="1020" height="277" data-file-width="1020" data-file-height="277"></a>
</p><p><br>
The data domain column (screenshot below) lists the domain set for each task. In order to view the task, the user needs to be a member of the data domain set for the task. Contractor B will not have permission to view the Contractor A and C tasks. The change manager group is not able to view the tasks since the change manager domain is not assigned to the task. 
￼
</p><p><a onclick="javascript:loadingImage(this);" class="image"><img alt="d4.png" src="/mediawiki/images/c/cf/d4.png" width="958" height="302" data-file-width="958" data-file-height="302"></a>
</p><p><br>
If the use case requires that the change manager group be able to view the tasks in the various data domains the best practice is to use the multi-select field for the data domain field available in the roles. Create a role and assign all the required data domains to it. Apply the role to the person or the group and then the user would have rights to view the data domains that are set.
</p><p><a onclick="javascript:loadingImage(this);" class="image"><img alt="d5.png" src="/mediawiki/images/e/e4/d5.png" width="990" height="391" data-file-width="990" data-file-height="391"></a><a href="./itom/File:d6.png" class="image"><img alt="d6.png" src="/mediawiki/images/7/7e/d6.png" width="584" height="811" data-file-width="584" data-file-height="811"></a>
</p><p><br>
</p><p>In this example the task plan is added to the change itself. If it is common to assign tasks to multiple groups, creating a task plan in a change model would save time when creating new changes. The model would then be applied to the change automatically, thus creating the task plan.
