<html><p>In addition to the out-of-box reports available for various Operations Bridge components in the Stakeholder Dashboard, you can build your own reports in external BI tools on top of the OPTIC Data Lake. To assist you in the process of designing your own reports in an external BI tool, we have published a white paper on the marketplace:&nbsp;<a href="https://marketplace.microfocus.com/itom/content/byobi">Guide to using an external BI tool for reporting on the Operations Bridge data in the COSO Data Lake</a>. The guide introduces the concept of building your own reports on top of the data in the OPTIC data lake. It showcases how to consume the data using example BI tools; Tableau, Microsoft Power BI, and Grafana (example screenshots below). You can carry out similar steps on the BI tool of your choice.</p>

<p><strong>Sample Reports:</strong> In addition to the guide, we have now published sample reports for Tableau, Microsoft Power BI and Grafana. You are free to download and use the sample reports as-is, or build on top of them. The guide includes the instructions on how to use the published templates in the respective BI tools.</p>

<p><strong>Cross Domain Dashboard:</strong>&nbsp;The dashboard below is an example of combining data from different domains in a single dashboard, i.e. system infrastructure, OBM events, and synthetic transaction monitoring (BPM) data. The dashboard was designed using Grafana.</p>
