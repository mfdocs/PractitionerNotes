<html><h3><strong>Problem</strong></h3>

<p>Whenever an artifact is assigned to a CI, there will be an entry created in ‘cfg_at_assignment_ci' table that maps CI id to the assignment id. When you try to delete all the assignments whose CI is already deleted, for a few of the assignments the &nbsp;mapping entry is missing and deletion of such assignments fail as it considers that there is no matching entry in the DB. As a result, events with ‘Deleting assignments failed during auto-assignment.‘ message are getting logged.</p>

<h3><strong>Work around </strong></h3>

<p>As described above, the deletion fails due to the missing entry in mapping table. As a workaround, you need to fetch all problematic assignments from the logs and get their assignment id and CI id from database and add the mapping entry into 'cfg_at_assignment_ci' table so that deletion of unused assignments can be successful.</p>

<p><strong style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Roboto, sans-serif; font-size: 20px;">Steps to achieve workaround (Queries are Oracle DB Compatible)</strong></p>

<ol>
	<li>Check if you got event with below-mentioned error message, if the message is not the same then this workaround would not help you.
	<p>‘Deleting assignments failed during auto-assignment.‘</p>

	<p>OR</p>

	<p>If you are getting below mentioned error message on selecting an assignment then that qualifies for the workaround.</p>

	<p>No <code>&lt;artifact&gt;</code> with id: "<code>&lt;assignment_type&gt;:&lt;artifact version id&gt;:&lt;ci id&gt;</code>" found.<br>
	<strong>Example</strong>: No TemplateAssignment with id: "<code>TemplateAssignment:c610e770-4812-b49d-c18d-5b7d35e951d7:40f8e0cd6c1c03739632cec8ad9011c5</code>" found.</p>
	</li>
</ol>

<ol start="2">
	<li>Look for log messages starting with 'caught unexpected exception when deleting assignment' in &lt;OBM&gt;\log\jboss\opr-configserver.log.* of DPS. Also make sure only those assignments for which you got the failing event&nbsp; or the UI error message are considered. The logs will have a string like below.
	<p>ManagementTemplateAssignment:84413803-d4aa-4470-8c3b-571987929bbd:decafc0ffeefacedbabef00ddeadbeef</p>

	<p>The string has 3 parts :<br>
	ManagementTemplateAssignment: Type of assignment(ManagementTemplateAssignment/AspectAssignment/TemplateAssignment)<br>
	Artifact version id: <code>84413803-d4aa-4470-8c3b-571987929bbd</code><br>
	CI Id: <code>decafc0ffeefacedbabef00ddeadbeef</code></p>

	<p><strong>Example:</strong><br>
	ERROR AssignmentService.call(?) - caught unexpected exception when deleting assignment ManagementTemplateAssignment:84413803-d4aa-4470-8c3b-571987929bbd:decafc0ffeefacedbabef00ddeadbeef</p>
	</li>
</ol>

<ol start="3">
	<li>Prepare SQL queries (refer below syntax) for all assignment IDs which are captured in step2. These queries are to be run on ‘event’ schema.
	<p><code>select direct_assignment_id from &lt;schema&gt;.cfg_at_assignment_ci where direct_assignment_id = (SELECT id FROM cfg_directassignment where ci_id='&lt;ci id&gt;' and version_object_id=’&lt;artifact version id&gt;') and ci_id != '&lt;ci id&gt;'</code></p>

	<p>Execute the queries on ‘event’ DB schema.</p>

	<p>And for whichever query we get the output (direct_assignment_id) only those assignment details are to be considered for next step. Here we just double check that there is a missing entry in mapping table and fetch its direct_assignment_id.</p>
	</li>
</ol>

<ol start="4">
	<li><span id="cke_bm_1231C" style="display: none;">&nbsp;</span>Insert missing records into cfg_at_assignment_ci table for entries received in step3.

	<p>Insert query will look like this:<br>
	<code>INSERT INTO &lt;schema&gt;.cfg_at_assignment_ci ("id", "ci_id", "direct_assignment_id") values (‘&lt;id&gt;','&lt;ci id&gt;','&lt;artefact version id&gt;')</code></p>

	<p>The '<strong>direct_assignment_id</strong>’ will be taken from the query output in Step3.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The <b>id</b>&nbsp;needs to be generated. You need to generate new UUID and provide it to the query.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For <strong>ci_id</strong> put the ci_id you got from error string(Eg: ManagementTemplateAssignment:84413803-d4aa-4470-8c3b-571987929bbd:decafc0ffeefacedbabef00ddeadbeef, 3rd part here will be ci_id which is - decafc0ffeefacedbabef00ddeadbeef).<br>

Run all those insert queries on 'event' DB schema. Perform ‘commit.’</p>

	<p>Once you perform all of the above steps, the mapping entries will be created in ‘cfg_at_assignment_ci’ for all the problematic assignments and as a result, you will be able to delete all the unused assignments.</p>

<strong style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Roboto, sans-serif; font-size: 20px;">Validation to check if workaround works</strong>

<p>By default, Topo scan will run for every 12 hours which will delete all assignments whose CI's are already deleted. To validate whether the Topo scan runs without any errors, you can change the Infrastructure setting ‘ Time interval to scan for changed topology ’ to 5 mins to cross-check the fix immediately. After you confirm the fix works, please revert time interval value back to its previous value.</p>
