<html><p>Adobe will stop distributing and updating its <a href="https://www.adobe.com/products/flashplayer/enterprise-end-of-life.html">Flash Player after 31 December 2020</a>, with the major browser vendors removing Adobe Flash support at the same time. Adobe Flash components in software products will no longer function after this date.</p>

<p>All versions of Operations Bridge Manager (aka OMi) included Flash-based components. Upgrade today to OBM 2020.10&nbsp;to remove Adobe Flash from the operational UI. Then, apply a future in-place update to remove the remaining Adobe Flash from the administrative UI.</p>

<p>OBM functionality that contained Adobe Flash that now has improved usability and performance</p>
