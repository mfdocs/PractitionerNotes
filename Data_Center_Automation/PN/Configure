<div>Many of the tasks available in NA change the configuration of the target devices. Some tasks also reboot devices, temporarily making them unavailable and changing the device configuration when the startup and running configurations differ.</div><div>By default NA completes these tasks as scheduled, without reminding the user that the tasks impact device configurations.
