entry to a node for all applications that uses the BBC API. All applications
that wish to receive messages needs to register an address with the CB.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">The local or remote applications may either query the BBC CB
for the location of the application or use the BBC CB as an HTTP proxy to
forward the request to the appropriate registered application.&nbsp; The process of establishing a connection from
one host to another is quite complex and involves multiple packet exchanges
between two endpoints, which can be quite time consuming. <o:p></o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">The BBC communication broker handles the HTTP requests
through a combination of a thread pool and a connection pool . Since these HTTP
connections are represented finally by sockets, a connection pool is nothing
but pool of sockets. In BBC terms it is known as Socket Set. The pool of
threads services the pool of sockets. The connections are either HTTP or HTTPS
connection based on whether certificate is installed or not. The default ratio
of the threads that handle the Http connections from the connection pool is
1:10; this is based on an assumption that at any point in time , 10 % of the
connections would be active and sending the requests to the server. The default
size of the Connection Pool and threads is 60 and 6 respectively. <o:p></o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">This means that Connection pool that contains 60 connections
(to be more specific set of sockets) will be handled by 6 threads. Whenever a
request arrives on BBC communication broker, one of the threads which is
waiting on system calls select or poll,&nbsp;
will read the request and based on the url of the HTTP request it
invokes the handler and once the handling of the request is over , it joins
back the thread pool. If for example the no of connections exceeds 60 , which
is the default size of the socket set, a new socket set is created .This new
socket set would be served by yet another&nbsp;
new pool 6 threads(default value). A socket set and associated threads
would be released once all the sockets in the pool are closed.&nbsp; Please note that the Socket Set grows
linearly as the connections increase and there is no rebalancing to the socket
set once the sockets are closed. Hence it is possible to have multiple Sockets
sets which has multiple connections and in the worst case scenario where all
sockets are closed except one&nbsp; it is
possible to have a socket set which has a single socket and 6 threads catering
to it. The socket set and associated resources including thread pool will be
cleared once the socket set is empty. This is why in case of large number of
connections tuning of SOCKETS_PER_SOCKETSET and MAX_SOCKETSET_THREADS&nbsp; is important.<o:p></o:p></p></a></div><div><a name="_Toc460834962" style="font-weight: normal;"><br></a></div><p class="MsoNormal"><o:p></o:p></p>
