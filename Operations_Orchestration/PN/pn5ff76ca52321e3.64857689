<html><p>After installing OO it will automatically start.&nbsp; What it won't do after a server reboot is restart.&nbsp;<br>
The current documentation has no reference on how to start up the software just installed.</p>

<p>This is a mini addendum to one of the most important things you need to know an Administrator and installer of the OO software.<br>
How to stop, start and restart the OO Central and set it up so this task happens on server reboot.</p>

<p>The command-line tool for this action is found in&nbsp;/opt/microfocus/oo/central/bin</p>
