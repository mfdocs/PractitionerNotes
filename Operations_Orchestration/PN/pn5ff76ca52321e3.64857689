<html><p>After installing OO it will automatically start.&nbsp; What it won't do after a server reboot is restart.&nbsp;<br>
The current documentation has no reference on how to start up the software just installed.</p>

<p>This is a mini addendum to one of the most important things you need to know an Administrator and the installer of the OO software.<br>
How to stop, start and restart the OO Central and set it up so this task happens on server reboots.</p>

<p>The command-line tool for this action is found in&nbsp;/opt/microfocus/oo/central/bin</p>

<pre><code># cd /opt/microfocus/oo/central
# ./central
Usage: ./central [ console | start | stop | restart | condrestart | status | install | remove | dump ]

Commands:
  console      Launch in the current console.
  start        Start in the background as a daemon process.
  stop         Stop if running as a daemon or in another console.
  restart      Stop if running and then start.
  condrestart  Restart only if already running.
  status       Query the current status.
  install      Install to start automatically when system boots.
  remove       Uninstall.
  dump         Request a Java thread dump if running.

<p>Setting OO to automatically start on reboot</p>

<pre><code># ./central install
Detected RHEL or Fedora:
Installing the Micro Focus Operations Orchestration Central daemon..
</code></pre>

<p>This creates the following symlink even on a RedHat 7 instead of using the native SystemD process.</p>

<pre><code># ls -l /etc/init.d/MICROFOCUSOOCentral
lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 40 Jan  7 20:11 /etc/init.d/MICROFOCUSOOCentral -&gt; /opt/microfocus/oo/central/bin/./central
</code></pre>
