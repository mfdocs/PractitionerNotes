<p>Micro Focus Operations Orchestration (OO) uses business intelligence available in a content pack to automate certain IT processes. Business intelligence inside a content pack is defined in the form of flows. A flow is the composition of steps and transitions forming a set of actions that are linked by decision-making logic in order to automate routine tasks. Some of the example routine tasks are rebooting servers, applying patches on servers, health checks, troubleshooting, etc.&nbsp;</p><p>Enterprises integrate OO with their IT Service Management systems, Event management systems, Network management systems, etc to run routine tasks in OO using REST APIs. Some of the example use cases that enterprises achieve with integration of OO are:</p><p><ul><li>Free up disk space on a server based on an event in their Event Management system.</li><li>Restart a failed service on a server based on an event in their Event Management system.</li><li>Provision a virtual machine based on a request in their IT Service Management and/or Hybrid Cloud Management system.</li><li>Reset a userâ€™s password based on a request in their IT Service Management system.</li></ul><div>Applications that need to be integrated with OO can be classified into the following categories:<br></div><div><ul><li>Applications with built-in integrations to OO</li></ul><div>There are built-in integrations with OO for some of the Micro Focus products such as Operations Bridge, Service Management Automation, Hybrid Cloud Management, etc. These built-in integrations with OO have to be configured to make it operational. Refer to the appropriate production documentation to enable and configure integrations.<br></div><ul><li>Applications without built-in integrations to OO</li></ul><div>Applications that do not have built-in integrations with OO have the following options to integrate with OO: OO Shell (OOSH) utility and REST APIs.<br></div></div></p><div><ol><li>OO Shell (OOSH) utility</li></ol><div>The OOSH utility is a Micro Focus supplied command line utility which is available for download as a standalone installation package. The OOSH utility allows you to perform various actions on OO such as launching OO flows, deploying content packs, etc from command line. The OOSH utility uses REST API to communicate with OO Central. The OOSH utility can be installed on the same remote server that hosts the application to be integrated with OO. Applications can then be configured to call OOSH command line utility to trigger OO flows based on certain events within the application.&nbsp;<br></div><div><br></div><div>Executing OO flows from OOSH involves the following steps:<br></div><div><div><ul><li>Trigger OO flow execution</li><li>Get status of OO flow execution</li></ul><div><b>Trigger OO flow execution</b><br></div></div></div><div><div>To trigger OO flow execution, invoke OOSH command line utility as follows:&nbsp;</div><div>oosh.bat trigger --uuid &lt;OO flow UUID&gt; --inputs &lt;Comma separated key value map of inputs&gt; --user &lt;user with privileges to run the flow&gt; --password &lt;User password&gt; --url &lt;OO Central URL&gt;</div><div><br></div><div>The following sample screenshot shows oosh command triggering an OO flow. In this sample screenshot, the OO flow was successfully triggered and its execution ID was returned by OO Central.</div></div><div><br></div><div><img src="./mediawiki/images/PN/OO-TriggerFlow-OOSHTrigg.png"><br></div><ol><li>REST APIs</li></ol></div>
