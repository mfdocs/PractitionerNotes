<p class="MsoNormal">Organizations are embracing DevOps practices that combine
software development and information technology operations. DevOps practices
shorten the systems development life cycle while delivering features, fixes and
updates frequently in close alignment with business objectives. &nbsp;Continuous integration and continuous
deployment processes of DevOps includes the following activities:<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Development<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Large enterprises running Micro Focus Operations Orchestration
(OO) often have several OO developers and separate environments for
development, test and production. OO developers develop OO content packs and
commit their code changes to version control system. An OO content pack
contains business intelligence to automate certain IT processes. OO content
packs are developed using the OO studio application or the OO web designer
application.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Build<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">After content pack code changes are committed to version
control system, a new version of content pack is built using the OO Shell
Authoring (OOSHA) utility. The OOSHA utility builds OO content pack using
contents of a project folder downloaded from version control repository.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Deployment<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">After OO content pack is built, it needs to be deployed onto
OO Central Application for testing and use in production environment. OO
content pack is deployed onto OO Central Application in one of the following
ways:<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class="MsoListParagraphCxSpFirst"></p><ol><li>Using OO Central UIâ€™s deploy content pack
feature. This method requires manual login to the OO Central server and cannot
be used to deploy content packs in an automated fashion.</li><li>Using Operations Orchestration Shell (OOSH)
utility. This method requires installation of additional piece of software.</li><li>Using OO REST API. A REST API is an
application program interface (API) that uses HTTP requests to GET, PUT, POST
and DELETE data in an application.</li></ol><o:p></o:p><p></p>

<p class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle"><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class="MsoListParagraphCxSpLast"><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Either the OOSH utility or OO REST API can be used to deploy
content packs in an automated fashion. Certain enterprises may prefer to use OO
REST APIs to deploy content packs for the following reasons:<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class="MsoListParagraphCxSpFirst"></p><ol><li>Eliminate need to install an additional
piece of software on their content build and deploy systems.</li><li>Integrate into existing deployment
automation mechanisms. </li><li>Gain more control around automation of
deployment of content packs to OO Central.&nbsp;</li></ol><p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Test<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">After content pack has been deployed, testing of newly
deployed content pack can be automated or done manually.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">This article shows a sample power shell script that can be
used to automate deployment of OO content pack to OO Central Application.
Intent of this script is to show how to invoke OO REST APIs to automate deployment
of OO content packs to OO Central Application. This script can be further
enhanced to perform additional checks required for your environment, to improve
performance, to use as a reference to develop it in your preferred programming language,
to use as a reference to make other OO REST API calls, etc. At a high level,
this script performs the following:<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class="MsoListParagraphCxSpFirst"></p><ol><li>Validates the following input values: OO
Central Application URL, OO Central username, OO Central user password, OO content
pack name and OO content pack file</li><li>Retrieves cross reference token from OO
Central Application URL</li><li>Uses cross reference token to deploy content
pack to OO Central Application.</li></ol><o:p></o:p><p></p>

<p class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle"><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class="MsoListParagraphCxSpLast"><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Usage of the script is described at the
beginning of this script and functioning of this script is explained in
comments throughout the script.<o:p></o:p></p>
