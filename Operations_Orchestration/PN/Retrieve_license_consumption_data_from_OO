Micro Focus Operations Orchestration (OO) licenses are sold in packs of 10 units. A unit of licensing provides entitlement to orchestrate various nodes in a pre-defined ratio. This pre-defined ratio defines how many virtual machine nodes, server, storage or network nodes are entitled in a 10 unit license. For example, as of July 2019, a 10 unit license entitles 10 server nodes or 10 storage nodes or 20 virtual machine nodes, etc. This pre-defined ratio of unit to nodes is subject to change.&nbsp; Work with your sales representative and account management team to obtain latest unit to nodes ratio.&nbsp;
