Micro Focus Operations Orchestration (OO) uses business intelligence available in a content pack to automate certain IT processes. OO content packs are developed using the OO Studio application or the OO Web Designer application. Both OO Studio and OO Web Designer allows a developer to test and debug content pack locally and remotely on OO Central Server.&nbsp; Developers prefer to debug their OO content pack flows on a remote OO Central Server for the following reasons:<div><div><ol><li>Run time environment of OO Studio and OO Web Designer is different from OO Central Server.</li><li>Isolate and troubleshoot content pack flow issues on a live production OO Central Server.</li><li>Debug flow changes without making actual flow library changes on OO Central Server. Once results are satisfactory, content pack changes can be pushed to OO Central Server.</li></ol></div></div><div>When a remote debugger is run for an OO flow in an OO Studio that OO flow is run on a remote OO Central Server. Flows that are run remotely have a prefix of “Debug” in the “Run Name” of their flow execution. The following is a sample screenshot from OO Central UI showing two “SSH” OO flows that were run from a remote debugger. These two SSH OO flows have a prefix of “Debug” in their run name. The “Generate Random Number” flow runs were not debug runs as they do not have the prefix of “Debug” in their flow run name.<br></div><div><br></div><div><img src="./mediawiki/images/PN/OO-PurgeDebugEvents-RunExplorer.png"><br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div>
