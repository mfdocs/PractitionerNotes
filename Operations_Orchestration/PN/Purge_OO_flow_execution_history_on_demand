Micro Focus Operations Orchestration (OO) uses business intelligence available in a content pack to automate certain IT processes. Business intelligence inside a content pack is defined in the form of flows. A flow is the composition of steps and transitions forming a set of actions that are linked by decision-making logic in order to automate tasks. For example, health checks, troubleshooting, or any other repetitive IT support tasks. An OO flow has inputs and outputs. Flow takes inputs, performs tasks based on its inputs and generates output. Flows are designed and developed in Studio, Workflow Designer and then run in OO Central. A flow run is a single execution of a flow in OO Central.&nbsp; A flow is like a class definition in an object oriented programming language. A flow run or a flow execution is similar to instantiation of an object from a class definition.&nbsp;<div><br></div><div>A flow run or flow execution collects data and stores it in database. This flow run data is then visible in the OO Central UI.&nbsp; Every flow execution contributes to increase in database size as it stores data in the database. It is highly recommended to purge flow execution data periodically to maintain optimal performance of Operations Orchestration. Use the following ways to purge database on a recurring basis:<br></div><div><ol><li>Micro Focus supplied database maintenance scripts.<br></li><li>Micro Focus supplied purging flows which are available in the solutions content pack.&nbsp;<br></li></ol><div>This article shows a power shell script that can be used to purge flow execution data on-demand. Here are some of the script use cases and caveats:<br></div></div><div><br></div><div><b>Script use cases</b><br></div><div><div style=""><ul><li>Use this script to purge flow execution data as required.</li><li>Sometimes, developers may forget to hide sensitive information such as passwords in an OO flow. Use this script to immediately remove flow execution data containing sensitive information. This helps prevent others from seeing sensitive information in OO Central UI.</li><li>Use this script to selectively purge execution data for certain flows.</li></ul><div><b>Script caveats</b></div><div><div style=""><ul><li>Use caution when running this script. This script purges flow execution data and cannot be recovered unless you have a database backup.</li><li>Do not use this script to perform mass purge of flow execution data.</li><li>Do not schedule this script to purge flow execution data on a recurring basis. Instead, use Micro Focus supported database maintenance purge scripts and purging flows in the solution content pack. This script is not meant to replace Micro Focus supported database maintenance purge scripts and purging flows in the solutions content pack.</li></ul><div><br></div></div></div></div></div>
