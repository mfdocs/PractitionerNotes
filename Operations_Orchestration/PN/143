Micro Focus Operations Orchestration (OO) uses business intelligence available in a content pack to automate certain IT processes. Business intelligence inside a content pack is defined in the form of flows. A flow is the composition of steps and transitions forming a set of actions that are linked by decision-making logic in order to automate tasks. For example, rebooting servers, applying patches on servers, health checks, troubleshooting, or any other repetitive IT support tasks. An OO flow has inputs and outputs. An OO flow is usually written as generically as possible and performs tasks on different objects based on its inputs and generates output.<div><br><div>An organization automating their routine tasks is interested in the following details:<br></div></div><div><div><ul><li>A list of objects that were orchestrated by routine tasks such as rebooting servers, password resets, etc in OO.&nbsp; Some of the example objects are a list of servers that were rebooted in the last week, a list of user ids for which passwords were reset in the last month, etc.&nbsp;</li><li>Outcome of routine tasks on those objects.</li></ul><div><br></div><div>A routine task such as "reboot server" correlates to a single flow definition in OO. For each invocation of the “reboot server” routine task, corresponding OO flow is launched with a different hostname as input for that OO flow. With each launch of OO flow, the flow is executed and its flow execution data is stored in the database. This flow execution data consists of flow inputs, flow outputs, step inputs and step outputs. Object data such as server hostname, user ids, etc is usually supplied as one of the flow inputs and routine task outcome is available as flow output or flow status. Organizations can retrieve a list of “objects acted upon” by routine tasks and their outcome by retrieving OO flow execution inputs, outputs and their values. The following options are available in OO to retrieve flow execution inputs, outputs and their values:<br></div></div></div><div><br></div><div><ol><li>Database query</li><li>REST APIs</li></ol><div><b>Database query</b></div></div><div><br></div><div>OO flow input data is stored in the "OO_EXECUTION_BOUND_INPUTS" table. OO flow output data is stored in the "OO_EXECUTION_BOUND_OUTPUTS" table.

The Unix epoch time is the number of seconds that have elapsed since January 1, 1970 midnight UTC. There are websites and tools that allow you to convert human readable date to epoch and vice versa. Use appropriate "start_time_long" values. Try to limit the number of rows returned to a minimum by using UNIX GMT epoch time not older than 30 days. Otherwise, there may be a potential impact to database and OO performance.</div></div><div><br></div></blockquote><blockquote style="margin: 0 0 0 40px; border: none; padding: 0px;"><div><div>The following screenshot shows query results from a sample query. In this sample query, flow execution inputs and its values were retrieved for the "Reboot Server" flow executions that were started after 01/01/2020 00:00:00 GMT. The "Reboot Server" flow was run twice after 01/01/2020 00:00:00 GMT. During first invocation of reboot server flow, server1.xxx.net was rebooted and during second invocation of the reboot server flow, server2.xxx.net was rebooted.</div></div><div><br></div><div><img src="./mediawiki/images/PN/OO-RetrieveFlowInputsAndOutputs-InputQueryOutput.png"><br></div><div><br></div></blockquote></li><li>HELLO</li></ol></div>
