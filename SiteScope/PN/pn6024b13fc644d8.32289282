<p><strong>Problem:</strong></p>

<p>When Monitor Reports are generated from sitescope root node or for a high number of monitors, report might fail to show data.</p>

<p><b>Reason:</b></p>

<p>This occurs beacuse Internet exporer doesn't support json response which is greater than 40 mb. When the json response is greater than 40 mb, IE doesn't parse the response.</p>
