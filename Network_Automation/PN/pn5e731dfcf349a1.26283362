<p>Network Automation(NA) offers software upgrade of standalone network devices out of the box. But some of the newer devices like Cisco ASA firewalls can be deployed in a cluster. To upgrade the software on these, NA needs to be cluster aware.&nbsp;</p>

<p>NA offers tools to upgrade device software of clusters. This article shows how the Multi-Task Project, Change Plans and Update Device Software Task capabilities of NA can be used to upgrade Cisco ASA firewalls in a cluster.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Implementation</h2>

<ol>
	<li>Import the change plans into NA</li>
	<li>Create two device groups&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Create a <strong>Multi-Task Project</strong> template</li>
</ol>

<h3>Import Change Plans into NA</h3>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;There are three Change Plans created to solve the use case. They can be found in the appendix below. Save the contents in a file and import them from the Change Plans page in UI. Refer <a href="https://docs.microfocus.com/itom/Network_Automation:2019.05/ManageChangePlans#Import/export_change_plans">documentation</a> on how to import change plans.</p>
