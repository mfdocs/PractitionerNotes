<p>Network Automation(NA) offers software upgrade of standalone network devices out of the box. But some of the newer devices like Cisco ASA firewalls can be deployed in a cluster. To upgrade the software on these, NA needs to be cluster aware.&nbsp;</p>

<p>NA offers tools to upgrade device software of clusters. In this blog I have used the Multi-Task Project, Change Plans and Update Device Software Task capabilities of NA to upgrade Cisco ASA firewalls in a cluster.</p>
