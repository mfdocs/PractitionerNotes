<html><p>Adobe will stop distributing and updating its&nbsp;<a href="https://www.adobe.com/products/flashplayer/enterprise-end-of-life.html">Flash Player after 31 December 2020</a>, with the major browser vendors removing Adobe Flash support at the same time. Adobe Flash components in software products will no longer function after this date.</p>

<p>Versions of Network Automation before 2019.05 Patch 2 included some Flash-based content. If you are using a version older than 2019.05 Patch 2, upgrade now to keep all NA functionality running after Adobe Flash end-of-life.</p>

<p>NA functionality that contained Adobe Flash</p>

<ul>
	<li>Device Selector â€“ selecting devices, device groups and device selector buttons<br>
	A non-Flash option has been available since NA 10.21. To completely remove Flash files from the installation, upgrade to NA 2019.05 Patch 2. After upgrading to NA 2019.05, consider upgrading to <a href="https://docs.microfocus.com/itom/Network_Automation:2020.08/ReleaseNotes">NA 2020.08</a>.<br>
	&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
