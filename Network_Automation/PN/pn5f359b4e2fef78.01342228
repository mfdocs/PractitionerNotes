<html><p>Adobe will stop distributing and updating its&nbsp;<a href="https://www.adobe.com/products/flashplayer/enterprise-end-of-life.html">Flash Player after 31 December 2020</a>, with the major browser vendors removing Adobe Flash support at the same time. Adobe Flash components in software products will no longer function after this date.</p>

<p>Versions of Network Automation before 2019.05 Patch 2 included some Flash-based content. If you are using a version older than 2019.05 Patch 2, upgrade now to keep all NA functionality running after Adobe Flash end-of-life.</p>
