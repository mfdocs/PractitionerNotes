Similarly the NA cores should be in the same time zone as PostgreSQL database. Before you perform the steps in this document, refer the release notes and support matrix for the particular NA version. Also, if COSO is currently used, then make sure that the NA version you have supports COSO Reporting with&nbsp;PostgreSQL database.</span></span></p>
