<p style="font-size: 18px; margin: 0px 0px 12px;">Network Automation (NA) provides a central repository of device software, including operating system (OS) images, that you can deploy to one or more devices that share the same software. Having a central storage location guarantees that the last known good software is available in-house.</p><p style="font-size: 18px; margin: 0px 0px 12px;">You can:</p><ul style="margin-left: 18px; margin-top: 0px; padding: 0px 0px 0px 4px; margin-bottom: 0px; font-size: 18px;"><li>Upload software image sets into the system. An image set is a grouping of images that can be deployed to a device simultaneously. An image set can contain one or more images. When you initiate a software upload, you select an image set to be uploaded. Each image in the image set is uploaded in turn. If the device has a problem (e.g. out of memory), the rest of the upload is aborted.</li><li>Add or upload files to a device.</li><li>Define the minimum requirements for an image set, such as the device family, device model, minimum RAM, processor, or boot ROM version required to run the image successfully.</li><li>Prepare a device prior to deploying an image by deleting files to free up flash memory space, and/or compacting the flash memory.</li><li>Reboot a device after deploying an image.</li><li>Schedule updates through NA. For example, you might deploy a new image to one device successfully during the day shift, then schedule updates to many more devices during off-peak hours.</li><li>Define multiple compliance ratings to identify software versions and upgrade devices as resources permit.</li><li>Designate which image should be the Boot image for devices that have multiple Boot images. You can select a Boot image, and if necessary an OS image, currently on the device, or transfer a new Boot and/or OS image. If you select a single Boot and/or OS image, commands are issued on the device to set those images as the images to use for Boot and/or OS. Depending on the device, these will not take affect until the next time the device reboots, which can be selected as part of the Update Device Software task.</li></ul>
