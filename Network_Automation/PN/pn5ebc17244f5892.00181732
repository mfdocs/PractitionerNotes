<html><p>Python is a powerful and popular programming language with huge capabilities for automation use cases.<br>
Network Automation(NA) is one of the leading tools in the market for network device configuration, change and compliance management. Power of NA can be further enhanced with the use of Python.<br>
<br>
In this article I have tried to list down the procedure to enable the use of Python as an advanced scripting language in NA.</p>

<h3><strong>Pre-requisites</strong></h3>

<ul>
	<li>Install Python (2.7&nbsp;or 3.4+&nbsp;version) on the NA server</li>
	<li>Install Paramiko - Paramiko is an SSH library for Python. It can be installed using <b>"pip"</b></li>
</ul>
