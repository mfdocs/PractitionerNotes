<html><p>Python is a powerful and popular programming language with huge capabilities for automation use cases.<br>
Network Automation(NA) is one of the leading tools in the market for network device configuration, change and compliance management. Power of NA can be further enhanced with the use of Python.<br>
<br>
In this article I have tried to list down the procedure to enable the use of Python as an advanced scripting language in NA.</p>

<h3><strong>Pre-requisites</strong></h3>

<ul>
	<li>Install Python (2.7&nbsp;or 3.4+&nbsp;version) on the NA server</li>
	<li>Install Paramiko on the NA server - Paramiko is an SSH library for Python. It can be installed using <b>"pip"</b></li>
</ul>

<h3><br>
<b style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: MetricHPE_Medium; font-size: 20px;">Configure Python interpreter in NA</b></h3>
NA needs to know the location of the interpreter before executing the scripts. Location of the Python binary, which is installed on the NA server, needs to be provided in the NA UI. To do that -&nbsp;

<ol>
	<li>Login to NA UI</li>
	<li>Navigate to the Server settings page (Admin -&gt; Administrative Settings -&gt; Server)</li>
	<li>Locate the <strong>Advanced Scripting</strong> section in the page.</li>
	<li>Pick any of the empty scripting language and provide the details
	<ul>
		<li>Scripting Language <em>&lt;n&gt;</em>&nbsp;- name of the language as it needs to appear in the UI</li>
		<li>Path to Interpreter <em>&lt;n&gt; -</em>&nbsp;location of the python binary. (For example, on Linux -&nbsp;/usr/bin/python)</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Save the changes</li>
</ol>

<h4><strong>Verify the configuration</strong></h4>
The changes made in the Server settings will result in a new option while creating a new advanced Diagnostic/Change Plan.

<ol>
	<li>Navigate to New Diagnostic page (Devices -&gt; Device Tools -&gt; Diagnostics -&gt; New Diagnostic)</li>
	<li>Select the <strong>Advanced Scripting</strong> checkbox</li>
	<li>Verify that the <strong>Language&nbsp;</strong>drop down has the newly added scripting language.</li>
</ol>
